<P>In the following description, each argument must be a single word;
field is used for a single uppercase or lowercase
letter naming a field; fields is used for a sequence of such letters;
m and n are used for a nonnegative numbers; string
is used for an arbitrary string; filename is used for the name of a file.

abbreviate*fieldsstring1
</TD><TD>
Abbreviate the first names of fields. An initial letter will be separated from another
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
string2string3string4
</TD><TD>
initial letter by string1, from the last name by string2, and from anything else
(such as a von or de) by string3. These default to a period followed by a space. In
a hyphenated first name, the initial of the first part of the
name will be separated from the hyphen by string4; this defaults to a period. No attempt is made to handle
any ambiguities that might result from abbreviation. Names are abbreviated
before sorting and before label construction.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
abbreviate-label-ranges*string
</TD><TD>
Three or more adjacent labels that refer to consecutive references will be
abbreviated to a label consisting of the first label, followed by
string, followed by the last label. This is mainly useful with numeric labels. If
string is omitted it defaults to _.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
accumulate*
</TD><TD>
Accumulate references instead of writing out each reference as it is
encountered. Accumulated references will be written out whenever a reference of the form:
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.[
$LIST$
.]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
is encountered, after all input files have been processed, and whenever an
.R1 line is recognized.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

If macro is omitted, it will default to AP;if

or newline.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

</TD><TD>
Search the bibliographic databases
filename... For each filename if an index
filename.i created by gindxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each
index can cover multiple databases.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
date-as-label*string
</TD><TD>
string is a label expression that specifies a string with which to replace the
D field after constructing the label. See &quot;Label Expressions,&quot; later in this manual page, for
a description of label expressions. This command is useful if you do not want
explicit labels in the reference list, but instead want to handle any necessary
disambiguation by qualifying the date in some way. The label used in the text would typically
be some combination of the author and date. In most cases, you should also use the
no-label-in-reference command. For example,
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
date-as-label D.+yD.y%a*D.-y
would attach a disambiguating letter to the year part of the
D field in the reference.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
default-database*
</TD><TD>
The default database should be searched. This is the default behavior, so the
negative version of this command is more useful.
refer determines whether the default database should be searched on the first occasion that it needs to do a search. Thus,
a no-default-database command must be given before then, in order to be effective.
