If the popd command is successful, a dirs is performed as well, and the return
status is 0. popd returns False if an illegal option is encountered, the directory stack
is empty, a nonexistent directory stack entry is specified, or the directory change fails.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
pushd [dir] pushd +/_n
</TD><TD>
Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making
the new top of the stack the current working directory. With no arguments,
exchanges the top two directories and returns 0, unless the directory stack is empty.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

</TD><TD>
Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from
the left of the list shown by dirs) is at the top.

_n
</TD><TD>
Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from
the right) is at the top.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

Adds dir to the directory stack at the top, making it the
new current working directory.

If the pushd command is successful, a dirs is performed as well.
If the first form is used, pushd returns 0 unless the
cd to dir fails. With the second form, pushd returns
0 unless the directory stack is empty, a nonexistent directory stack element is
specified, or the directory change to the specified new current directory fails.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
pwd
</TD><TD>
Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory. The path
printed contains no symbolic links if the _P option to the
set builtin command is set. (See also the description of
nolinks under &quot;Shell Variables,&quot; earlier in this manual
page.) The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the pathname of
the current directory.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
read [_r][name ...]
</TD><TD>
One line is read from the standard input, and the first word is assigned to the
first name, the second word to the second name, and so on, with leftover words
assigned to the last name. Only the characters in
IFS are recognized as word delimiters. If no names are supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable
REPLY. The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered. If the
-r option is given, a backslash-newline pair is not ignored, and the backslash is considered to be part of the line.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
readonly [_f][name ...]
</TD><TD>
The given names are marked
readonly and the values of these names may not be
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
readonly -p
</TD><TD>
changed by subsequent assignment. If the
_f option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the names are so marked. If no arguments are given, or if the <BR>
_p option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed. An argument of
&#151; disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. The return status is
0 unless an illegal option is encountered, one of the names is not a legal shell variable
name, or _f is supplied with a name that is not a function.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
return [n]
</TD><TD>
Causes a function to exit with the return value specified by
n. If n is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in the function body. If
used outside a function, but during execution of a script by the
. (source) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return
either n or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script. If
used outside a function and not during execution of a script by
(. , the return status is False.
