discard*fields
</TD><TD>
When the reference is read,
fields should be discarded; no string definitions
for fields will be output. Initially, fields are
XYZ.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
et-al*stringmn
</TD><TD>
Control use of et al in the evaluation of
@ expressions in label expressions. If the number of authors needed to make the author sequence unambiguous is
u and the total number of authors is t, then the last
t _ u authors will be replaced by string, provided that
t _ u is not less than m and t is not less than n. The default behavior
is et-al &quot; et al&quot; 2 3.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
includefilename
</TD><TD>
Include filename and interpret the contents as commands.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
join-authorsstring1
</TD><TD>
This says how authors should be joined together. When there are exactly two
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
string2string3
</TD><TD>
authors, they will be joined with
string1. When there are more than two authors, all but the last two will be joined with
string2, and the last two authors will be joined with
string3. If string3 is omitted, it will default to
string1; if string2 is also omitted, it will also default to
string1. For example,

join-authors &quot; and &quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;, and &quot;

will restore the default method for joining authors.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
label-in-reference*
</TD><TD>
When outputting the reference, define the string
[F to be the reference's label. This is the default behavior; so the negative version of this command is more useful.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
label-in-text*
</TD><TD>
For each reference, output a label in the text. The label will be separated from
the surrounding text as described in the
bracket-label command. This is the default behavior; so the negative version of this command is more useful.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
labelstring
</TD><TD>
string is a label expression describing how to label each reference.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
separate-label-second-parts
</TD><TD>
When merging two-part labels, separate the second part of the second label from the
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
string
</TD><TD>
first label with string. See the description of the
&lt;&gt; label expression.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
move-punctuation*
</TD><TD>
In the text, move any punctuation at the end of line past the label. It is usually
a good idea to give this command unless you are using superscripted numbers
as labels.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
reverse*string
</TD><TD>
Reverse the fields whose names are in
string. Each field name can be followed by a number that says how many such fields should be reversed. If no number is given
for a field, all such fields will be reversed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
search-ignore*fields
</TD><TD>
While searching for keys in databases for which no index exists, ignore the
contents of fields. Initially, fields XYZ are ignored.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
search-truncate*n
</TD><TD>
Only require the first n characters of keys to be given. In effect, when searching for
a given key, words in the database are truncated to the maximum of
n and the length of the key. Initially, n is 6.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
short-label*string
</TD><TD>
string is a label expression that specifies an alternative (usually shorter) style of
label. This is used when the # flag is given in the citation. When using author-date
style labels, the identity of the author or authors is sometimes clear from the context,
and so it may be desirable to omit the author or authors from the label. The
short-label command will typically be used to specify a label containing just a date and
possibly a disambiguating letter.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
sort*string
</TD><TD>
Sort references according to string. References will automatically be
accumulated. string should be a list of field names, each followed by a number, indicating
how many fields with the name should be used for sorting.
+ can be used to indicate that all the fields with the name should be used. Also,
. can be used to indicate the references should be sorted using the (tentative) label. (The &quot;Label
Expressions&quot; subsection describes the concept of a tentative label.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
sort-adjacent-labels*
</TD><TD>
Sort labels that are adjacent in the text according to their position in the
reference list. This command should usually be given if the
abbreviate-label-ranges command has been given, or if the label expression contains a
&lt;&gt; expression. This will have no effect unless references are being accumulated.

LABEL EXPRESSIONS
</B>
</P>

<P>Label expressions can be evaluated both normally and tentatively. The result of normal evaluation is used for output.
The result of tentative evaluation, called the tentative label, is used to gather the information that normal evaluation needs
to disambiguate the label. Label expressions specified by the
date-as-label and short-label commands are not
evaluated tentatively. Normal and tentative evaluation are the same for all types of expression other than
@, *, and % expressions. The following description applies to normal evaluation, except where otherwise specified.

<TR><TD>
field, field n
</TD><TD>
The nth part of field. If n is omitted, it defaults to
1.

`string'
</TD><TD>
The characters in string literally.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
@
</TD><TD>
All the authors joined as specified by the
join-authors command. The whole of each author's
name will be used. However, if the references are sorted by author (that is the sort specification starts
with A+), then authors' last names will be used instead, provided that this does not introduce ambiguity,
and also an initial subsequence of the authors may be used instead of all the authors, again provided
that this does not introduce ambiguity. The use of only the last name for the
i-th author of some reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is some other reference, such that the first
i - 1 authors of the references are the same, the
i-th authors are not the same, but the i-th authors' last names are
the same. A proper initial subsequence of the sequence of authors for some reference is considered to
be ambiguous if there is a reference with some other sequence of authors that also has that subsequence
as a proper initial subsequence. When an initial subsequence of authors is used, the remaining authors
are replaced by the string specified by the et-al command; this command may also specify
additional requirements that must be met before an initial subsequence can be used.
@ tentatively evaluates to a canonical representation of the authors, such that authors that compare equally for sorting purpose
will have the same representation.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
%n, %a, %A, %i, %I
</TD><TD>
The serial number of the reference formatted according to the character following the
%. The serial number of a reference is 1 plus the number of earlier references with same tentative label as
this reference. These expressions tentatively evaluate to an empty string.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
expr*
</TD><TD>
If there is another reference with the same tentative label as this reference, then
expr; otherwise, an empty string. It tentatively evaluates to an empty string.

expr+n, expr_n
</TD><TD>
The first (+) or last (_) n uppercase or lowercase letters or digits of
expr. troff special characters (such as \(`a) count as a single letter. Accent strings are retained but do not count toward the total.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
expr.l
</TD><TD>
expr converted to lowercase.

expr.r
</TD><TD>
expr reversed so that the last name is first.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
expr.a
</TD><TD>
expr with first names abbreviated. Note that fields specified in the
abbreviate command are abbreviated before any labels are evaluated. Thus
.a is useful only when you want a field to be abbreviated in
a label but not in a reference.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
expr.y
</TD><TD>
The year part of expr.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
expr.+y
</TD><TD>
The part of expr before the year, or the whole of
expr if it does not contain a year.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
expr._y
</TD><TD>
The part of expr after the year, or an empty string if
expr does not contain a year.

</TD><TD>
The last name part of expr.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

The concatenation of expr1 and
expr2.

The label is in two parts, which are separated by
expr. Two adjacent two-part labels that have the
same first part will be merged by appending the second part of the second label onto the first label
separated by the string specified in the
