.openastreamfilename
</TD><TD>
Like open, but if
filename exists, append to it instead of truncating it.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.pnr
</TD><TD>
Print the names and contents of all currently defined number registers on
stderr.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.psocommand
</TD><TD>
This behaves like the so request except that input comes from the standard output of
command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.ptr
</TD><TD>
Print the names and positions of all traps (not including input line traps and diversion traps)
on stderr. Empty slots in the page trap list are printed as well, because they can affect the priority
of subsequently planted traps.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.rcharc1c2...
</TD><TD>
Remove the definitions of characters
c1, c2, ... This undoes the effect of a char request.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.rj, .rjn
</TD><TD>
Right justify the next n input lines. Without an argument, right justify the next input line.
The number of lines to be right justified is available in the
\n[.rj] register. This implicitly does .ce0. The
ce request implicitly does .rj0.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.rnnxxyy
</TD><TD>
Rename number register xx to yy.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.shcc
</TD><TD>
Set the soft hyphen character to c. If
c is omitted, the soft hyphen character will be set to
the default \(hy. The soft hyphen character is the character that will be inserted when a word
is hyphenated at a line break. If the soft hyphen character does not exist in the font of the
character immediately preceding a potential break point, then the line will not be broken at that
point. Neither definitions (specified with the
char request) nor translations (specified with the
tr request) are considered when finding the soft hyphen character.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.shiftn
</TD><TD>
In a macro, shift the arguments by
n positions: argument i becomes argument i_n; arguments
1 to n will no longer be available. If n is missing, arguments will be shifted by
1. Shifting by negative amounts is currently undefined.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.specials1s2...
</TD><TD>
Fonts s1, s2 are special and will be searched for characters not in the current font.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.stynf
</TD><TD>
Associate style f with font position
n. A font position can be associated either with a font or with
a style. The current font is the index of a font position and
so is also either a font or a style. When it is a style, the font that is actually used is the font the name of which is the concatenation of
the name of the current family and the name of the current style. For example, if the current font is
1 and font position 1 is associated with style R and the current font family is
T, then font TR will be used. If the current font is not a
style, then the current family is ignored. When the requests
cs, bd, tkf, uf, or fspecial are applied to a style, then they will instead be applied to the member of
the current family corresponding to that style. The default family can be set with the
_f option. The styles command in the DESC file controls which font positions (if any) are initially associated
with styles rather than fonts.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.tkffs1n1s2n2
</TD><TD>
Enable track kerning for font
f. When the current font is f, the width of every character will
be increased by an amount between n1 and n2; when the current point size is less than or equal to
s1, the width will be increased by n1; when it is greater than or equal to
s2, the width will be increased by n2; when the point size is greater than or equal to
s1 and less than or equal to s2, the increase in width is a linear function of the point size.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.trffilename
</TD><TD>
Transparently output the contents of file
filename. Each line is output as it would be were
it preceded by \!; however, the lines are not subject to copy-mode interpretation. If the file does
not end with a newline, then a newline will be added. For example, you can define a macro
x containing the contents of file f, using
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.dix
.trff
.di
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Unlike with the cf request, the file cannot contain characters such as
NUL that are not legal troff input characters.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.trnt abcd
</TD><TD>
This is the same as the tr request except that the translations do not apply to text that is
transparently throughput into a diversion with \!. For example,
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.tr ab
.di x
\!.tm a
.di
.x
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

will print b; if trnt is used instead of
tr, it will print a.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.troff
</TD><TD>
Make the n built-in condition false, and the
t built-in condition true. This undoes the effect of
the nroff request.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.vptn
</TD><TD>
Enable vertical position traps if n is nonzero, disable them otherwise. Vertical position traps
are traps set by the wh or dt requests. Traps set by the
it request are not vertical position traps. The parameter that controls whether vertical position traps are enabled is global. Initially,
vertical position traps are enabled.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.warnn
</TD><TD>
Control warnings. n is the sum of the numbers associated with each warning that is to be
enabled; all other warnings will be disabled. The number associated with each warning is listed in
the &quot;Warnings&quot; subsection. For example, .warn
0 will disable all warnings, and .warn 1 will disable
all warnings except that about missing characters. If
n is not given, all warnings will be enabled.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.whilecanything
</TD><TD>
While condition c is true, accept
anything as input; c can be any condition acceptable to an
if request; anything can comprise multiple lines if the first line starts with
\{ and the last line ends with \}. See also the
break and continue requests.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.writestreamanything
</TD><TD>
Write anything to the stream named
stream. stream must previously have been the subject of
an open request. anything is read in copy mode; a leading will be stripped.

EXTENDED REQUETS

<TR><TD>
.cffilename
</TD><TD>
When used in a diversion, this will embed in the diversion an object which, when reread, will
cause the contents of filename to be transparently copied through to the output. In UNIX
troff, the contents of filename are immediately copied through to the output regardless of whether there is
a current diversion; this behavior is so anomalous that it must be considered a bug.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.evxx
</TD><TD>
If xx is not a number, this will switch to a named environment called
xx. The environment should be popped with a matching
ev request without any arguments, just as for numbered
environments. There is no limit on the number of named environments; they will be created the first time
that they are referenced.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.fpnf1f2
</TD><TD>
The fp request has an optional third argument. This argument gives the external name of the
font, which is used for finding the font description file. The second argument gives the internal name
of the font, which is used to refer to the font in
troff after it has been mounted. If there is no
third argument, then the internal name will be used as the external name. This feature allows you to
use fonts with long names in compatibility mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.ssmn
</TD><TD>
When two arguments are given to the
ss request, the second argument gives the sentence space
size. If the second argument is not given, the sentence space size will be the same as the word space
size. Like the word space size, the sentence space is in units of one twelfth of the
spacewidth parameter for the current font. Initially, both the word space size and the sentence space size are 12.
The sentence space size is used in two circumstances: If the end of a sentence occurs at the end of a
line in fill mode, then both an interword space and a sentence space will be added; if two spaces
follow the end of a sentence in the middle of a line, then the second space will be a sentence space.
Note that the behavior of UNIX troff will be exactly that exhibited by GNU
troff if a second argument is never given to the
ss request. In GNU troff, as in UNIX troff, you should always follow
a sentence with either a newline or two spaces.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.tan1n2...nnTr1r2...rn
</TD><TD>
Set tabs at positions
n1, n2,...,nn and then set tabs at nn+r1, nn+r2,....,
nn+rn and then at nn+rn+r1, nn+rn+r2,..., nn+rn+rn, and so on. For example,
.ta T .5i will set tabs every half an inch.
