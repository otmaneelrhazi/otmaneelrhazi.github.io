Grid
</TD><TD>
This command controls the grid in the editing area. If the grid spacing is below
the value specified by gridTolerance resource (8 by default), the grid will be
automatically turned off. It can be enforced by explicitly activating this command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Dashed
</TD><TD>
This command controls the stipple for drawing the grid lines. The stipple
specified by dashes resource can be turned on or off by activating this command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Axes
</TD><TD>
This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of the image being
edited. The actual lines are not part of the image. They are provided to aid user
when constructing symmetrical images, or whenever having the main axes
highlighted helps your editing.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Stippled
</TD><TD>
This command controls the stippling of the highlighted areas of the bitmap
image. The stipple specified by stipple resource can be turned on or off by activating
this command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Proportional
</TD><TD>
This command controls the proportional mode. If the proportional mode is
on, width and height of all image squares are forced to be equal, regardless of
the proportions of the bitmap window.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Zoom
</TD><TD>
This command controls the zoom mode. If there is a marked area of the
image already displayed, bitmap will automatically zoom into it. Otherwise, the user
will have to highlight an area to be edited in the zoom mode and bitmap will
automatically switch into it. You can use all the editing commands and other utilities in
the zoom mode. When you zoom out, undo command will undo the whole
zoom session.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Cut
</TD><TD>
This commands cuts the contents of the highlighted image area into the internal
cut and paste buffer.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Copy
</TD><TD>
This command copies the contents of the highlighted image area into the
internal cut and paste buffer.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Paste
</TD><TD>
This command will check if there are any other bitmap applications with
a highlighted image area, or if there is something in the internal cut and paste
buffer and copy it to the image. To place the copied image, click in the editing window
and drag the outlined image to the position where you want to place i, and then
release the button.

<P><B>
CUT AND PASTE
</B></P>


<P>Bitmap supports two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal cut and paste and the global X selection cut and paste.
The internal cut and paste is used when executing copy and move drawing commands and also cut and copy commands from
the Edit menu. The global X selection cut and paste is used whenever there is a highlighted area of a bitmap image
displayed anywhere on the screen. To copy a part of image from another bitmap editor, simply highlight the desired area by using
the Mark command or pressing the shift key and dragging the area with the left mouse button. When the selected area
becomes highlighted, any other applications (such as xterm) that use primary selection will discard their selection values
and unhighlight the appropriate information. Now, use the Paste command from the Edit menu or control mouse button
to copy the selected part of image into another (or the same) bitmap application. If you attempt to do this without a
visible highlighted image area, the bitmap will fall back to the internal cut and paste buffer and paste whatever was stored there
at the moment.

WIDGEST

<P>Following is the widget structure of the bitmap application. The widget class name is given first, followed by the
widget instance name. All widgets except the bitmap widget are from the standard Athena widget set.
