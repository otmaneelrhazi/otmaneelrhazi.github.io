_T commandfile, _Tcommandfile

_t

Prints names of input FILES as ld processes them.

_u sym
</TD><TD>
Forces sym to be entered in the output file as an undefined symbol. This may, for
example, trigger linking of additional modules from standard libraries.
_u may be repeated with different option arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Ur
</TD><TD>
For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to
_r : it generates relocatable output, that is, an output file that can in turn serve as input to
ld. When linking C++ programs, _Ur will resolve references to constructors, unlike
_r.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

Display the version number for ld

_warn_common
</TD><TD>
Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with a
symbol definition. UNIX linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice, but linkers on some
other operating systems do not. This option allows you to find potential problems
from combining global symbols.

Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module that refers to it.

<P>GNUTARGET.<BR>
GNUTARGET determines the input-file object format if you don't use
_b (or its synonym _format). Its value should be one of
the BFD names for an input format. If there is no
GNUTARGET in the ENVIRONMENT, ld uses the natural format of the host.
If GNUTAR-GET is set to default, then BFD attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input FILES; this
method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to
flag object-file FORMATS is unique. However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system places the conventional
format for that system first in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.

<P>lispmtopgm&#151;Convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file into PGM format

<P><B>DESCRIPTION</B></P>


<P>lispmtopgm reads a Lisp machine bitmap as input and produces a portable graymap as output.
</P>

<P>This is the file format written by the
tv:write-bit-array-file function on TI Explorer and Symbolics Lisp machines.
</P>

<P>Multiplane bitmaps on Lisp machines are color; but the
lispm image file format does not include a colormap, so it must
be treated as a graymap instead. This is unfortunate.

<P><B>BUGS</B></P>


<P>The lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky; Usually the image in the file has its width rounded up to the next
higher multiple of 32, but not always. If the width is not a multiple of 32, we don't deal with it properly, but because of the
lispm microcode, such arrays are probably not image data anyway.
</P>

<P>Also, the lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you are writing a bitmap that is not
mod32 across, the file may be up to seven bits too short. They round down instead of up, and we don't handle this bug gracefully.
</P>

<P>No color.
