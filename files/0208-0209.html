<P>getopt prints an error message on the standard error output when it encounters an option letter not included in
optstring.

HISTORY
</B>
</P>

<P>Written by Henry Spencer, working from a Bell Labs manual page. Behavior believed identical to the Bell version.

BUGS
</B>
</P>


<P>Whatever getopt(3) has.
</P>
<P>Arguments containing whitespace or embedded shell meta characters generally will not survive intact; this looks easy to
fix but isn't.
</P>
<P>The error message for an invalid option is identified as coming from
getopt rather than from the shell procedure
containing the invocation of getopt; this, again, is hard to fix.
</P>
<P>The precise best way to use the set command to set the arguments without disrupting the value(s) of shell options
varies from one shell version to another.

<P>gindxbib&#151;Make inverted index for bibliographic databases
</P>

<P><B>
SINOPSIS
</B>
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
gindxbib [_vw] [_c file] [_d dir] [_f file] [_h n] [_i string]
[_k n] [_l n] [_n n] [_o file] [_t n] [filename ...]

<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

DESCRIPTION
</B>
</P>



<P>gindxbib makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases in
filename... for use with grefer(1), glookbib(1),
and lkbib(1). The index will be named filename.i; the index is written to a temporary file which is then renamed to this. If
no filenames are given on the command line because the
_f option has been used, and no _o option is given, the index will
be named Ind.i.
</P>
<P>Bibliographic databases are divided into records by blank lines. Within a record, each fields starts with a
% character at the beginning of a line. Fields have a one-letter name that follows the
% character.
</P>

<P>The values set by the _c, _n, _l, and _t options are stored in the index; when the index is searched, keys will be discarded
and truncated in a manner appropriate to these options; the original keys will be used for verifying that any record found
using the index actually contains the keys. This means that a user of an index need not know whether these options were used
in the creation of the index, provided that not all the keys to be searched for would have been discarded during indexing
and that the user supplies at least the part of each key that would have remained after being truncated during indexing. The
value set by the _i option is also stored in the index and will be used in verifying records found using the index.

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_v
</TD><TD>Print the version number.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_w
</TD><TD>Index whole files. Each file is a separate record.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_cfile
</TD><TD>Read the list of common words from
file instead of /usr/lib/groff/eign.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_ddir
</TD><TD>Use dir as the pathname of the current working directory to store in the index, instead of the path
printed by pwd(1). Usually dir will be a symbolic link that points to the directory printed by
pwd(1).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_ffile
</TD><TD>Read the files to be indexed from
file. If file is _, files will be read from the standard input. The
_f option can be given at most once.

_istring
</TD><TD>Don't index the contents of fields whose names are in
string. Initially, string is XYZ.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_hn
</TD><TD>Use the first prime greater than or equal to
n for the size of the hash table. Larger values of
n will usually make searching faster, but will make the index larger and
gindxbib use more memory. Initially, n is 997.

_kn
</TD><TD>Use at most n keys per input record. Initially,
n is 100.

basename.i.

_tn
