DESCRIPTION
</B></P>


<P>This manual page documents the GNU version of
chown. chown changes the user and/or group ownership of each given
file, according to its first nonoption argument, which is interpreted as follows. If only a username (or numeric user ID) is
given, that user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is not changed. If the username is followed by a colon
or dot and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership of the files is changed
as well. If a colon or dot but no group name follows the username, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of
the files is changed to that user's login group. If the colon or dot and group are given, but the username is omitted, only
the group of the files is changed; in this case, chown performs the same function as chgrp.

<P>ci&#151;Check in RCS revisions</P>

<B>
SYNOPSIS
</B>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
ci [options] file ...
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->


<P><B>
DESCRIPTION
</B></P>


<P>ci stores new revisions into RCS files. Each pathname matching an RCS suffix is taken to be an RCS file. All others
are assumed to be working files containing new revisions.
ci deposits the contents of each working file into the
corresponding RCS file. If only a working file is given,
ci tries to find the corresponding RCS file in an RCS subdirectory and then in
the working file's directory. (For more details, see &quot;File Naming,&quot; later in this manual page.)
</P>
<P>For ci to work, the caller's login must be on the access list, unless the access list is empty or the caller is the superuser or
the owner of the file. To append a new revision to an existing branch, the tip revision on that branch must be locked by
the caller. Otherwise, only a new branch can be created. This restriction is not enforced for the owner of the file if
non-strict locking is used; see rcs(1). A lock held by someone else can be broken with the rcs command.
</P>
<P>Unless the _f option is given, ci checks whether the revision to be deposited differs from the preceding one. If not, instead
of creating a new revision ci reverts to the preceding one. To revert, ordinary
ci removes the working file and any lock; ci _l keeps and
ci _u removes any lock, and then they both generate a new working file much as if
co _l or co _u had been applied to the preceding revision. When reverting, any
_n and -s options apply to the preceding revision.
</P>
<P>For each revision deposited, ci prompts for a log message. The log message should summarize the change and must
be terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing
. by itself. If several files are checked in, ci asks whether to reuse
the previous log message. If the standard input is not a terminal,
ci suppresses the prompt and uses the same log message for
all files. (See also _m.)
</P>
<P>If the RCS file does not exist, ci creates it and deposits the contents of the working file as the initial revision
(default number: 1.1). The access list is initialized to empty. Instead of the log message,
ci requests descriptive text (See _t.)
</P>
<P>The number rev of the deposited revision can be given by any of the options
_f, _i, _I, _j, _k, _l, _M, _q, _r, or _u. rev can
be symbolic, numeric, or mixed. Symbolic names in
rev must already be defined; see the _n and _N options for assigning
names during checkin. If rev is $, ci determines the revision number from keyword values in the working file.
</P>
<P>If rev begins with a period, then the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to it. If
rev is a branch number followed by a period, then the latest revision on that branch is used.
</P>
<P>If rev is a revision number, it must be higher than the latest one on the branch to which
rev belongs, or must start a new branch.
</P>
<P>If rev is a branch rather than a revision number, the new revision is appended to that branch. The level number is
obtained by incrementing the tip revision number of that branch. If
rev indicates a nonexistent branch, that branch is created with
the initial revision numbered rev.1.
</P>
<P>If rev is omitted, ci tries to derive the new revision number from the caller's last lock. If the caller has locked the tip
revision of a branch, the new revision is appended to that branch. The new revision number is obtained by incrementing the
tip revision number. If the caller locked a nontip revision, a new branch is started at that revision by incrementing the
highest branch number at that revision. The default initial branch and level numbers are
1.
</P>
<P>If rev is omitted and the caller has no lock, but owns the file and locking is not set to strict, then the revision is appended
to the default branch. (Normally the trunk; see the
_b option of rcs(1).)
</P>
<P>Exception: On the trunk, revisions can be appended to the end, but not inserted.
