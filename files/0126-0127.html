SYNOPSIS
</B></P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
elvis [flags][+cmd][files...]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P><B>
DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>elvis is a text editor that emulates vi/ex.
<P>On systems which pass the program name as an argument, such as UNIX and Minix, you may also install
elvis under the names ex, vi, view, and input. These extra names would normally be links to
elvis; see the ln shell command.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-127"><P>Page 127</P></A>


<P>
When elvis is invoked as vi, it behaves exactly as though it was invoked as
elvis. However, if you invoke elvis as view, then the
readonly option is set as though you had given it the
-R flag. If you invoke elvis as ex, then elvis will start up in
the colon command mode instead of the visual command mode, as though you had given it the
-e flag. If you invoke elvis as input or edit, then
elvis will start up in input mode, as though the
-i flag was given.
</P>

<P><B>
OPTIONS
</B></P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
-r
</TD><TD>
To the real vi, this flag means that a previous edit should be recovered.
elvis, though, has a separate program, called
elvrec(1), for recovering files. When you invoke
elvis with -r, elvis will tell you to run elvrec.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-R
</TD><TD>
This sets the readonly option, so you won't accidentally overwrite a file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-s
</TD><TD>
This sets the safer option, which disables many potentially harmful commands. It has not
been rigorously proven to be absolutely secure, however.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-t tag
</TD><TD>
This causes elvis to start editing at the given tag.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-m [file]
</TD><TD>
elvis will search through file for something that looks like an error message from a compiler.
It will then begin editing the source file that caused the error, with the cursor sitting on the line
where the error was detected. If you don't explicitly name a file, then
errlist is assumed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-e
</TD><TD>
elvis will start up in colon command mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-v
</TD><TD>
elvis will start up in visual command mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-i
</TD><TD>
elvis will start up in input mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-w winsize
</TD><TD>
Sets the window option's value to winsize.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
+command or -c command
</TD><TD>
If you use the
+command parameter, then after the first file is loaded,
command is executed as an EX command. A typical example would be
elvis +237 foo, which would cause elvis to start
editing foo and then move directly to line 237. The
-c command variant was added for UNIX SysV compatibility.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><B>
FILES
</B></P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
/tmp/elv*
</TD><TD>
During editing, elvis stores text
in a temporary file. For UNIX, this file will usually be stored
in the /tmp directory, and the first three characters will be
elv. For other systems, the temporary files may be stored someplace else; see the version-specific section of the documentation.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
tags
</TD><TD>
This is the database used by the :tags command and the
-t option. It is usually created by the ctags(1) program.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.exrc or elvis.rc
</TD><TD>
On UNIX-like systems, a file called
.exrc in your home directory is executed as a series of
ex commands. A file by the same name may be executed in the current directory, too. On
non-UNIX systems, .exrc is usually an invalid filename; there, the initialization file is called
elvis.rc instead.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P><B>
ENVIRONMENT
</P></B>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
TERM
</TD><TD>
This is the name of your terminal's entry in the
termcap or terminfo database. The list of legal values varies from one system to another.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
TERMCAP
</TD><TD>
Optional. If your system uses
termcap, and the TERMCAP variable is unset, then
elvis will read your terminal's definition from
/etc/termcap. If TERMCAP is set to the full pathname of a file (starting
with a /) then elvis will look in the named file instead of
/etc/termcap. If TERMCAP is set to a value which doesn't start with a
/, then its value is assumed to be the full
termcap entry for your terminal.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
TERMINFO
</TD><TD>
Optional. If your system uses
terminfo, and the TERMINFO variable is unset, then
elvis will read your terminal's definition from the database in the
/usr/lib/terminfo database. If TERMINFO is set, then
its value is used as the database name to use instead of
/usr/lib/terminfo.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
LINES, COLUMNS
</TD><TD>
Optional. These variables, if set, will override the screen size values given in the
termcap/terminfo for your terminal. On windowing systems such as X,
elvis has other ways of determining the screen size, so you should probably leave these variables unset.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
EXINIT
</TD><TD>
Optional. This variable can hold EX commands which will be executed instead of the
.exrc file in your home directory.
