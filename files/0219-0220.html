BIBLIOGRAPRIC DATABASES
</B>
</P>

<P>The bibliographic database is a text file consisting of records separated by one or more blank lines. Within each record,
fields start with a % at the beginning of a line. Each field has a one-character name that immediately follows the
%. It is best to use only uppercase and lowercase letters for the names of fields. The name of the field should be followed by exactly one
space, and then by the contents of the field. Empty fields are ignored. The conventional meaning of each field is as follows:
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
A
</TD><TD>
The name of an author. If the name contains a title such as Jr. at the end, it should be separated from
the last name by a comma. There can be multiple occurrences of the
A field. The order is significant. It is a good idea always to supply an
A field or a Q field.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
B
</TD><TD>
For an article that is part of a book, the title of the book.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
C
</TD><TD>
The place (city) of publication.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
D
</TD><TD>
The date of publication. The year should be specified in full. If the month is specified, the name
rather than the number of the month should be used, but only the first three letters are required. It is a good
idea always to supply a D field; if the date is unknown, a value such as
in press or unknown can be used.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
E
</TD><TD>
For an article that is part of a book, the name of an editor of the book. Where the work has editors and
no authors, the names of the editors should be given as
A fields (ed) or (eds) should be appended to the
last author.

<P>For all fields except A and E, if there is more than one occurrence of a particular field in a record, only the last such field
will be used.
</P>
<P>If accent strings are used, they should follow the character to be accented. This means that the
AM macro must be used with the _ms macros. Accent strings should not be quoted: use one
\ rather than two.

CITATIONS
</B>
</P>


<P>The format of a citation is
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.[opening-text
flags keywords
fields
.]closing-text
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->


<A NAME="PAGENUM-220"><P>Page 220</P></A>

<P>The opening-text, closing-text, and flags components are optional. Only one of the
keywords and fields components need be specified.
</P>

<P>The keywords component says to search the bibliographic databases for a reference that contains all the words in
keywords. It is an error if more than one reference if found.
</P>

<P>The fields components specifies additional fields to replace or supplement those specified in the reference. When
references are being accumulated and the keywords component is nonempty, then additional fields should be specified only on the
first occasion that a particular reference is cited, and will apply to all citations of that reference.
</P>

<P>The opening-text and closing-text component specifies strings to be used to bracket the label instead of the strings
specified in the bracket-label command. If either of these components is nonempty, the strings specified in
the bracket-label command will not be used; this behavior can be altered using the
[ and ] flags. Note that leading and trailing spaces
are significant for these components.
</P>

<P>The flags component is a list of nonalphanumeric characters, each of which modifies the treatment of this
particular citation. UNIX refer will treat these flags as part of the keywords and so will ignore them because they
are nonalphanumeric. The following flags are currently recognized:
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
#
</TD><TD>
This says to use the label specified by the
short-label command, instead of that specified by the
label command. If no short label has been specified, the normal label will be used. Typically, the short label is used with
author-date labels and consists of only the date and possibly a disambiguating letter; the
# is supposed to be suggestive of a numeric type of label.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
[
</TD><TD>
Precede opening-text with the first string specified in the
bracket-label command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
]
</TD><TD>
Follow closing-text with the second string specified in the
bracket-label command.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>One advantage of using the [ and ] flags rather than including the brackets in
opening-text and closing-text is that you can change the style of bracket used in the document just by changing the
bracket-label command. Another advantage is that sorting and merging of citations will not necessarily be inhibited if the flags are used.
</P>

<P>If a label is to be inserted into the text, it will be attached to the line preceding the
.[ line. If there is no such line, then an extra line will be inserted before the
.[ line and a warning will be given.
</P>

<P>There is no special notation for making a citation to multiple references. Just use a sequence of citations, one for
each reference. Don't put anything between the citations. The labels for all the citations will be attached to the line preceding
the first citation. The labels may also be sorted or merged. (See the description of the
&lt;&gt; label expression, and of the sort-adjacent-
labels and abbreviate-label-ranges command.) A label will not be merged if its citation has a nonempty
opening-text or closing-text. However, the labels for a citation using the
] flag and without any closing-text immediately
followed by a citation using the [ flag and without any
opening-text may be sorted and merged even though the first
citation's opening-text or the second citation's
closing-text is nonempty. (If you want to prevent this, just make the first
citation's closing-text \&amp;.)

<P><B>
COMMANDS
</B>
</P>

<P>Commands are contained between lines starting with
.R1 and .R2. Recognition of these lines can be prevented by the
_R option. When an .R1 line is recognized, any accumulated references are flushed out. Neither
.R1 nor .R2 lines, nor anything between them, is output.
</P>

<P>Commands are separated by newlines or semicolons.
# introduces a comment that extends to the end of the line (but
does not conceal the newline). Each command is broken up into words. Words are separated by spaces or tabs. A word that
begins with an open quote (&quot;) extends to the next close quote (&quot;) that is not followed by another open quote (&quot;). If there is no
such open quote (&quot;) the word extends to the end of the line. Pairs of open quotes (&quot;) in a word beginning with collapse to a
single open quote (&quot;). Neither # nor ; is recognized inside open quotes (&quot;). A line can be continued by ending it with
\; this works everywhere except after a #.
</P>

<P>Each command name that is marked with * has an associated negative command
no-name that undoes the effect of name. For example, the
no-sort command specifies that references should not be sorted. The negative commands take no arguments.
