<P>RESERVED WORDS</P>
</B>

<P>Reserved words are words that have a special meaning to the shell. The following words are recognized as reserved
when unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see &quot;Shell Grammar,&quot; next) or the third word of a case or
for command:
</P>

<P>SHELL GRAMMAR</P>
</B>

<P><B>
SIMPLE COMMANDS
</P></B>

<P>A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by words and redirections separated by blank
and terminated by a control operator. The first word specifies the command to be executed. The remaining words are passed
as arguments to the invoked command.
</P>

<P>The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or
128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.
</P>


<P><B>
PIPELINES
</P></B>


<P>A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the character |. The format for a pipeline is
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
 [!]command [ | command2 ... ]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>The standard output of command is connected to the standard input of
command2. This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command. (See the &quot;Redirection&quot; section, later in this manual page.)
<P>If the reserved word ! precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical
NOT of the exit status of the last command. Otherwise, the status of the pipeline is the exit status of the last command. The shell waits for all commands
in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.
<P>Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (that is, in a subshell).

<B>
<P>LISTS</P>
</B>

<P>A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of these operators:
;, &amp;, &amp;&amp;, or ||, and terminated by one
of these: ;, &amp;, or &lt;newline&gt;.
</P>

<P>Of these list operators, &amp;&amp; and || have equal precedence, followed by
; and &amp;, which have equal precedence.
</P>

<P>If a command is terminated by the control operator
&amp;, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.
The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is
0. Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last
command executed.
</P>


<P>The control operators &amp;&amp; and || denote
AND lists and OR lists, respectively. An AND list has the form:
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
command &amp;&amp; command2
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->


<P>command2 is executed if, and only if, command returns an exit status of
Zero.
