_fall_virtual

Treat all possible member functions as virtual, implicitly. All member
functions (except for constructor functions and new or delete member operators) are treated
as virtual functions of the class where they appear.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
This does not mean that all calls to these member functions will be made
through the internal table of virtual functions. Under some circumstances, the compiler
can determine that a call to a given virtual function can be made directly; in these
cases the calls are direct in any case.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fdollars_in_identifiers
</TD><TD>
Permit the use of
$ in identifiers. Traditional C allowed the character
$ to form part of identifiers; by default, GNU C also allows this. However, ANSI C forbids $
in identifiers, and GNU C++ also forbids it by default on most platforms (though
on some platforms it's enabled by default for GNU C++ as well).

Use this option to instruct the compiler to be smarter about when it can
elide constructors. Without this flag, GNU C++ and

                                              A foo ();
                                              A x (foo ()); // x initialized by `foo ()', no ctor called
                                              A y = foo (); // call to `foo ()' heads to temporary, // y is
                                              initialized from the temporary.

<TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Note the difference. With this flag, GNU C++ initializes
y directly from the call to foo() without going through a temporary.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fenum_int_equiv
</TD><TD>
Normally GNU C++ allows conversion of
enum to int, but not the other way around. Use this option if you want GNU C++ to allow conversion of
int to enum as well.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fexternal_templates
</TD><TD>
Produce smaller code for template declarations, by generating only a single copy
of each template function where it is defined. To use this option successfully, you
must also mark all files that use templates with either
#pragma implementation (the definition) or #pragma
interface (declarations).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
When your code is compiled with
_fexternal_templates, all template instantiations are external. You must arrange for all necessary instantiations to appear in
the implementation file; you can do this with a
typedef that references each instantiation needed. Conversely, when you compile using the default option
_fno_ external_templates, all template instantiations are explicitly internal.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fno_gnu_linker
</TD><TD>
Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and destructors)
in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU linker is the
standard method of handling them). Use this option when you want to use a
non-GNU linker, which also requires using the
collect2 program to make sure the system linker includes constructors and destructors.
(collect2 is included in the GNU CC distribution.) For systems which must use
collect2, the compiler driver gcc is configured to do this automatically.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fmemoize_lookups_fsave_memorized
</TD><TD>
These flags are used to get the compiler to compile programs faster using
heuristics. They are not on by default since they are only effective about half the time. The
other half of the time programs compile more slowly (and take more memory).

</TD><TD>
The first time the compiler must build a call to a member function (or reference to
a data member), it must (1) determine whether the class implements
member functions of that name; (2) resolve which member function to call (which
involves figuring out what sorts of type conversions need to be made); and (3) check
the visibility of the member function to the caller. All of this adds up to
slower compilation. Normally, the second time a call is made to that member function
(or reference to that data member), it must go through the same lengthy process
again. This means that code like this:
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
                                             cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This &quot; &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; &quot;has&quot;&lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; &quot; legs.\n&quot;;
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
makes six passes through all three steps. By using a software cache, a &quot;hit&quot;
significantly reduces this cost. Unfortunately, using the cache introduces another layer
of mechanisms which must be implemented, and so incurs its own overhead.
_fmemorize_ lookups enables the software cache.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Because access privileges (visibility) to members and member functions may
differ from one function context to the next, g++ may need to flush the cache. With the
_fmemoize_lookups flag, the cache is flushed after every function that is compiled.
The _fsave_memorized flag enables the same software cache, but when the
compiler determines that the context of the last function compiled would yield the
same access privileges of the next function to compile, it preserves the cache. This is
most helpful when defining many member functions for the same class: with
the exception of member functions which are friends of other classes, each
member function has exactly the same access privileges as every other, and the cache need
not be flushed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fno_default_inline
</TD><TD>
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope. Otherwise, when you specify
_O, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled inline by default; that is, you don't need to
add inline in front of the member function name.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fno_strict_prototype
</TD><TD>
Consider the declaration
int foo;(). In C++, this means that the function
foo takes no arguments. In ANSI C, this is declared
int foo(void);. With the flag
_fno_strict_prototype, declaring functions with no arguments is equivalent to
declaring its argument list to be untyped, that is,
int foo(); is equivalent to saying int foo
(...);._fnonnull_objects. Normally, GNU C++ makes conservative
assumptions about objects reached through references. For example, the compiler must check
that a is not null in code like the following:

Checking that references of this sort have non-null values requires extra
code, however, and it is unnecessary for many programs. You can use
_fnonnull_objects to omit the checks for null, if your program doesn't require the default checking.

_fhandle_signatures_

These options control the recognition of  the signature and

specifying abstract types. By default, these constructs are not recognized.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fthis_is_variable
</TD><TD>
The incorporation of user-defined free store management into C++ has
made assignment to this an anachronism. Therefore, by default GNU C++ treats the
type of this in a member function of class X to be
X *const. In other words, it is illegal to assign to this within a class member function. However, for backwards
compatibility, you can invoke the old behavior by using
_fthis_is_variable.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_g
</TD><TD>
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (for DBX
or SDB or DWARF). GDB also can work with this debugging information. On
most systems that use DBX format, _g enables use of extra debugging information
that only GDB can use.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use
_g with _0. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results:
