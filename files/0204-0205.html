<P>For example, suppose you wanted a construct that cancels an expression by drawing a diagonal line through it:
</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<PRE>
.EQ
define cancel `special Ca'
.EN
.de Ca
.ds 0s \Z'\\*(0s'\v'\\n(0du'\D'l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\v'\\n(0hu'
..
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE //-->

<P>Then you could cancel an expression U with cancel
e.</P>

<P>Here's a more complicated construct that draws a box around an expression:
</P>
<!-- CODE //-->
<PRE>
.EQ
define box `special Bx'
.EN
.de Bx
.ds 0s \Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\
\Z'\v'\\n(0du+1n'\D'l \\n(0wu+2n 0'\D'l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\
\D'l -\\n(0wu-2n 0'\D'l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n&quot;\h'\\n(0wu+2n'

CUSTOMIZATION
</B>
</P>

<P>The appearance of equations is controlled by a large number of parameters. These can be set using the
set command.
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
setpn
</TD><TD>
This sets parameter p to value n; n is an integer. For example
set x_height 45
says that eqn should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>Possible parameters are as follows. Values are in units of hundredths of an em unless otherwise stated. These descriptions
are intended to be expository rather than definitive.
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
minimum_size
</TD><TD>
eqn will not set anything at a smaller point size than this. The value is in points.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
fat_offset
</TD><TD>
The fat primitive emboldens an equation by overprinting two copies of the equation
horizontally offset by this amount.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
over_hang
</TD><TD>
A fraction bar will be longer by twice this amount than the maximum of the widths of
the numerator and denominator; in other words, it will overhang the numerator and denominator
by at least this amount.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
accent_width
</TD><TD>
When bar or under is applied to a single character, the line will be this long. Normally, bar
or under produces a line whose length is the width of the object to which it applies; in the case of
a single character, this tends to produce a line that looks too long.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
delimiter_factor
</TD><TD>
Extensible delimiters produced with the left and right primitives will have a combined height
and depth of at least this many thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which the
subequation that the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
delimiter_shortfall
</TD><TD>
Extensible delimiters produced with the left and right primitives will have a combined height
and depth not less than the difference of twice the maximum amount by which the subequation
that the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis and this amount.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
null_delimiter_space
</TD><TD>
This much horizontal space is inserted on each side of a fraction.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
script_space
</TD><TD>
The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased by this amount.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
thin_space
</TD><TD>
This amount of space is automatically inserted after punctuation characters.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
medium_space
</TD><TD>
This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of binary operators.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
thick_space
</TD><TD>
This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of relations.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<CTBL>
<COLS=2>
<C>
x_height
<C>
The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as
x.
<C>
axis_height
<C>
The height above the baseline of the center of characters such as + and -. It is important that
this value be correct for the font you are using.
<C>
default_rule_thickness
<C>
This should set to the thickness of the
\(ru character, or the thickness of horizontal lines
produced with the \D escape sequence.
<C>
num1
<C>
The over command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.
<C>
num2
<C>
The smallover command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.
<C>
denom1
<C>
The over command will shift down the denominator by at least this amount.
<C>
denom2
<C>
The smallover command will shift down the denominator by at least this amount.
<C>
sup1
<C>
Normally superscripts will be shifted up by at least this amount.
<C>
sup2
<C>
Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits or numerators of smallover fractions will be
shifted up by at least this amount. This is usually less than
sup1.
<C>
sup3
<C>
Superscripts within denominators or square roots or subscripts or lower limits will be shifted up
by at least this amount. This is usually less than
sup2.
<C>
sub1
<C>
Subscripts will normally be shifted down by at least this amount.
<C>
sub2
<C>
When there is both a subscript and a superscript, the subscript will be shifted down by at least
this amount.
<C>
sup_drop
<C>
The baseline of a superscript will be no more than this amount below the top of the object
on which the superscript is set.
<C>
sub_drop
<C>
The baseline of a subscript will be at least this much below the bottom of the object on which
the subscript is set.
<C>
big_op_spacing1
<C>
The baseline of an upper limit will be at least this much above the top of the object on which
the limit is set.
<C>
big_op_spacing2
<C>
The baseline of a lower limit will be at least this much below the bottom of the object on which
the limit is set.
<C>
big_op_spacing3
<C>
The bottom of an upper limit will be at least this much above the top of the object on which
the limit is set.
<C>
big_op_spacing4
<C>
The top of a lower limit will be at least this much below the bottom of the object on which
the limit is set.
<C>
big_op_spacing5
<C>
This much vertical space will be added above and below limits.
<C>
baseline_sep
<C>
The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix will normally be this far apart. In most cases,
this should be equal to the sum of num1 and denom1.
<C>
shift_down
<C>
The midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom baseline in a matrix or pile will be
shifted down by this much from the axis. In most cases, this should be equal to
axis_height.
<C>
column_sep
<C>
This much space will be added between columns in a matrix.
<C>
matrix_side_sep
<C>
This much space will be added at each side of a matrix.
<C>
draw_lines
<C>
If this is nonzero, lines will be drawn using the
\D escape sequence, rather than with the \l escape sequence and the
\(ru character.
<C>
body_height
<C>
The amount by which the height of the equation exceeds this will be added as extra space
before the line containing the equation (using \x.) The default value is
85.
<C>
body_depth
<C>
The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds this will be added as extra space after
the line containing the equation (using \x.) The default value is
35.
<C>
nroff
<C>
If this is nonzero, then ndefine will behave like
define and tdefine will be ignored; otherwise,
tdefine will behave like define and ndefine will be ignored. The default value is
0. (This is typically changed to 1 by the eqnrc file for the
ascii and latin1 devices.)

The TeXbook.
