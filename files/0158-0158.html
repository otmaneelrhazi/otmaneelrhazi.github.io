variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move
where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they
compute constant results or their values were already at hand; some statements may execute
in different places because they were moved out of loops.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Nevertheless, it proves possible to debug optimized output. This makes it
reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Idir
</TD><TD>
Append directory dir to the list of directories searched for include files.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Ldir
</TD><TD>
Add directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for
_l.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_llibrary
</TD><TD>
Use the library named library when linking. (C++ programs often require
_lg++ for successful linking.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_nostdinc
</TD><TD>
Do not search the standard system directories for header files. Only the
directories you have specified with _I options (and the current directory, if appropriate)
are searched.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_nostdinc++
</TD><TD>
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to C++, but do
still search the other standard directories. (This option is used when building
libg++.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_O
</TD><TD>
Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_o file
</TD><TD>
Place output in file file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_S
</TD><TD>
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is
an assembler code file for each nonassembler input file specified.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_traditional
</TD><TD>
Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers. Specifically, for both
C and C++ programs:
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
In the preprocessor, comments convert to nothing at all, rather than to a space.
This allows traditional token concatenation.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
In the preprocessor, macro arguments are recognized within string constants in
a macro definition (and their values are stringified, though without additional
quote marks, when they appear in such a context). The preprocessor always considers
a string constant to end at a newline.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The preprocessor does not predefine the macro
STDC when you use _traditional, but still predefines
GNUC (since the GNU extensions indicated by GNUC are not affected
by _traditional). If you need to write header files that work differently depending
on whether _traditional is in use, by testing both of these predefined macros you
can distinguish four situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI C
compilers, and other old C compilers.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
In the preprocessor, comments convert to nothing at all, rather than to a space.
This allows traditional token concatenation.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
String &quot;constants&quot; are not necessarily constant; they are stored in writable space,
and identical looking constants are allocated separately. For C++ programs only (not
C), _traditional has one additional effect: assignment to this is permitted. This is
the same as the effect of _fthis_is_variable.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Umacro
</TD><TD>
Undefine macro macro.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Wall
</TD><TD>
Issue warnings for conditions that pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding
and that we believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction with macros.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Wenum_clash
</TD><TD>
Warn when converting between different enumeration types.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Woverloaded_virtual
</TD><TD>
In a derived class, the definitions of virtual functions must match the type
signature of a virtual function declared in the base class. Use this option to request
warnings when a derived class declares a function that may be an erroneous attempt to
define a virtual function; that is, warn when a function with the same name as a
virtual function in the base class, but with a type signature that doesn't match any
virtual functions from the base class.
