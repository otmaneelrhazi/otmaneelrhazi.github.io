<P>This default behavior can be changed by setting the button function resources. Here is an example:

bitmap*button1Function: Set
bitmap*button2Function: Clear
bitmap*button3Function: Invert
etc.

<P>The button function applies to all drawing commands, including copying, moving and pasting, flood filling, and setting
the hot spot.

DRAWING COMMANDS
</B></P>


<P>Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the buttons at the left side of
the application's window. Some commands can be aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap window, allowing the user to select different guiding points
where applicable.
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
Clear
</TD><TD>
This command clears all bits in the bitmap image. The grid squares will be set to
the background color. Pressing C inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Set
</TD><TD>
This command sets all bits in the bitmap image. The grid squares will be set to
the foreground color. Pressing S inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Invert
</TD><TD>
This command inverts all bits in the bitmap image. The grid squares will be
inverted appropriately. Pressing I inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Mark
</TD><TD>
This command is used to mark an area of the grid by dragging out a
rectangular shape in the highlighting color. After the area is marked, it can be operated on by
a number of commands (see Up, Down, Left, Right, Rotate, Flip, Cut, and so
on). Only one marked area can be present at any time. If you attempt to mark
another area, the old mark will vanish. The same effect can be achieved by pressing
Shift-MouseButton1 and dragging out a rectangle in the grid window. Pressing
Shift-MouseButton2 will mark the entire grid area.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Unmark
</TD><TD>
This command will cause the marked area to vanish. The same effect can
be achieved by pressing Shift-MouseButton3.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Copy
</TD><TD>
This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one location to another.
If there is no marked grid area displayed, Copy behaves just like Mark. Once there is
a marked grid area displayed in the highlighting color, this command has
two alternative behaviors. If you click a mouse button inside the marked area, you will
be able to drag the rectangle that represents the marked area to the desired
location. After you release the mouse button, the area will be copied. If you click outside
the marked area, Copy will assume that you wish to mark a different region of
the bitmap image, thus it will behave like Mark again.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Move
</TD><TD>
This command is used to move an area of the grid from one location to another.
Its behavior resembles the behavior of Copy command, except that the marked area
will be moved instead of copied.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Flip Horizontally
</TD><TD>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the horizontal axes. If
a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked
area. Pressing H inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Up
</TD><TD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel up. If a marked area of the grid
is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area. Pressing UpArrow inside
the bitmap window has the same effect.
