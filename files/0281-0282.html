tryaffix
</A></H3>

<P>The tryaffix shell script is used to estimate the effectiveness of a proposed prefix
(_p switch) or suffix (_s switch, the default) with a given
expanded-file. Only one affix can be tried with each execution of
tryaffix, although multiple arguments can be used to describe varying forms of the same affix flag (for example, the
D flag for English can add either D or ED depending
on whether a trailing E is already present). Each word in the expanded dictionary that ends (or begins) with the chosen suffix
(or prefix) has that suffix (prefix) removed; the dictionary is then searched for root words that match the stripped word.
Nor-mally, all matching roots are written to standard output, but if the
_c (count) flag is given, only a statistical summary of
the results is written. The statistics given are a count of words the affix potentially applies to and an estimate of the number
of dictionary bytes that a flag using the affix would save. The estimate will be high if the flag generates words that are
currently generated by other affix flags (for example, in English,
bathers can be generated by either bath/X or
bather/S). The diction-ary file, expanded-file, must already be expanded (using the
_e switch of ispell) and sorted, and things will usually
work best if uppercase has been folded to lower with
tr.
</P>

<P>The affix arguments are things to be stripped from the dictionary file to produce trial roots: for English,
con (prefix) and ing (suffix) are EXAMPLES. The
addition parts of the argument are letters that would have been stripped off the root before
adding the affix. For example, in English the affix
ing normally strips e for words ending in that letter (for example,
like becomes liking), so we might run

<P>All of the shell scripts contain documentation as commentary at the beginning; sometimes these comments contain
useful information beyond the scope of this manual page.

<P>It is possible to install ispell in such a way as to only support ASCII range text if desired.

icombine
</A></H3>

<P>The icombine program is a helper for munchlist. It reads a list of words in dictionary format (roots plus flags) from
the standard input, and produces a reduced list of standard output that combines common roots found on adjacent
entries. Identical roots that have differing flags will have their flags combined, and roots that have differing capitalizations will
be combined in a way that only preserves important capitalization information. The optional
aff-file specifies a language file that defines the character sets used and the meanings of the various flags. The
_T switch can be used to select among alternative string character types by giving a dummy suffix that can be found in an
altstringtype statement.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch01_ 133">
ijoin
</A></H3>

<P>The ijoin program is a reimplementation of join(1), which handles long lines and 8-bit characters correctly. The
_s switch specifies that the sort(1) program used to prepare the input to
ijoin uses signed comparisons on 8-bit characters; the
_u switch specifies that sort(1) uses unsigned comparisons. All other OPTIONS and behaviors of
join(1) are duplicated as exactly as possible based on the manual page, except that
ijoin will not handle newline as a field separator. See the
join(1) manual page for more information.

BUGS
</B></P>

<P>It takes several to many seconds for ispell to read in the hash table, depending on size.
</P>

<P>When all OPTIONS are enabled, ispell may take several seconds to generate all the guesses at corrections for a misspelled
word; on slower machines this time is long enough to be annoying.
</P>

<P>The hash table is stored as a quarter-megabyte (or larger) array, so a PDP-11 or 286 version does not seem likely.
</P>

<P>Ispell should understand more troff syntax, and deal more intelligently with contractions.
</P>

<P>Although small personal dictionaries are sorted before they are written out, the order of capitalizations of the same word
is somewhat random.
</P>

<P>When the _x flag is specified, ispell will unlink any existing BAK file.
</P>

<P>There are too many flags, and many of them have non-mnemonic names.
</P>

<P>munchlist does not deal very gracefully with dictionaries that contain nonword characters. Such characters ought to
be deleted from the dictionary with a warning message.
findaffix and munchlist require tremendous amounts of temporary
file space for large dictionaries. They do respect the
TMPDIR ENVIRONMENT variable, so this space can be redirected. However, a
lot of the temporary space needed is for sorting, so
TMPDIR is only a partial help on systems with an uncooperative
sort(1). (Cooperative is defined as accepting the undocumented
-T switch). At its peak usage, munchlist takes 10 to 40 times
the original dictionary's size in kilobytes. (The larger ratio is for dictionaries that already have heavy affix use, such as the
one distributed with ispell). munchlist is also very slow; munching a normal-sized dictionary (15KB roots, 45KB
expanded words) takes around an hour on a small workstation. (Most of this time is spent in
sort(1), and munchlist can run much faster on machines that have a more modern
sort that makes better use of the memory available to it.)
findaffix is even worse; the smallest English dictionary cannot be processed with this script in a mere 50KB of free space, and even
after specifying switches to reduce the temporary space required, the script will run for more than 24 hours on a small
workstation.
