DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>cvs is a front end to the rcs(1) revision control system, which extends the notion of revision control from a collection of
files in a single directory to a hierarchical collection of directories consisting of revision controlled files. These directories and
files can be combined together to form a software release.
cvs provides the functions necessary to manage these software
releases and to control the concurrent editing of source files among multiple software developers.
</P>

<P>cvs keeps a single copy of the master sources. This copy is called the source
repository; it contains all the information to permit extracting previous software releases at any time based on either a symbolic revision tag, or a date in the past.
</P>

<P><B>
ESSENTIAL COMMANDS
</B></P>

<P>cvs provides a rich variety of commands
(cvs_command in the Synopsis), each of which often has a wealth of options, to
satisfy the many needs of source management in distributed environments. However, you don't have to master every detail to
do useful work with cvs; in fact, five commands are sufficient to use (and contribute to) the source repository.
</P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
cvs checkout modules...
</TD><TD>
A necessary preliminary for most
cvs work: creates your private copy of the source
for modules (named collections of source; you can also use a path relative to the
source repository here). You can work with this copy without interfering with others' work.
At least one subdirectory level is always created.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cvs update
</TD><TD>
Execute this command from within your private source directory when you wish
to update your copies of source files from changes that other developers have made to
the source in the repository.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cvs add file...
</TD><TD>
Use this command to enroll new files in
cvs records of your working directory. The files will be added to the repository the next time you run
cvs commit. Note: You should use the cvs import command to bootstrap new sources into the source repository.
cvs add is only used for new files to an already checked-out module.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cvs remove file...
</TD><TD>
Use this command (after erasing any files listed) to declare that you wish to
eliminate files from the repository. The removal does not affect others until you
run cvs commit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cvs commit file...
</TD><TD>
Use this command when you wish to &quot;publish&quot; your changes to other developers,
by incorporating them in the source repository.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

OPTIONS
</B></P>

<P>The cvs command line can include cvs_options, which apply to the overall
cvs program; a cvs_command, which specifies a particular action on the source repository; and
command_options and command_arguments to fully specify what the
cvs_command will do.

WARNING
</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You must be careful of precisely where you place options relative to the
cvs_command. The same option can mean different things depending on whether it is in the
cvs_options position (to the left of a cvs command) or in the
command_options position (to the right of a cvs command).
</BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<P>There are only two situations where you may omit
cvs_command: cvs _H or cvs _help elicits a list of available commands,
and cvs _v or cvs _version displays version information on
cvs itself.
</P>

<P><B>
CVS OPTIONS
</B></P>

<P>As of release 1.6, cvs supports GNU style long options as well as short options. Only a few long options are
currently supported; these are listed in brackets after the short options whose functions they duplicate.
</P>

<P>Use these options to control the overall cvs program:</P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_H [_help]
</TD><TD>
Display usage information about the specified
cvs command (but do not actually execute the command). If you don't specify a command name,
cvs _H displays a summary of all the commands available.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Q
</TD><TD>
Causes the command to be really quiet; the command will generate output only for
serious problems.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_q
</TD><TD>
Causes the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages, such as reports
of recursion through subdirectories, are suppressed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_b bindir
</TD><TD>
Use bindir as the directory where RCS programs are located. Overrides the setting of the
RCSBIN environment variable. This value should be specified as an absolute pathname.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_d CVS_root_directory
</TD><TD>
Use CVS_root_directory as the root directory pathname of the master RCS source
repository. Overrides the setting of the CVS-ROOT environment variable. This value should be specified as
an absolute pathname.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_e editor
</TD><TD>
Use editor to enter revision log information. Overrides the setting of the
CVSEDITOR and the EDITOR environment variables.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_f
</TD><TD>
Do not read the cvs startup file (~/.cvsrc).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_l
</TD><TD>
Do not log the cvs_command in the command history (but execute it anyway). See the
description of the history command for information on command history.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_n
</TD><TD>
Do not change any files. Attempt to execute the
cvs_command, but only to issue reports; do not remove, update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_t
</TD><TD>
Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of
cvs activity. Particularly useful with _n to explore the potential impact of an unfamiliar command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-r
</TD><TD>
Makes new working files read-only. Same effect as if the
CVS-READ environment variable is set.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_v [_version]
</TD><TD>
Displays version and copyright information for cvs.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_w
</TD><TD>
Makes new working files read-write (default). Overrides the setting of the
CVSREAD environment variable.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_z compression_level
</TD><TD>
When transferring files across the network use
gzip with compression level compression_level to compress and decompress data as it is transferred. Requires the presence of the GNU
gzip program in the current search path at both ends of the link.
