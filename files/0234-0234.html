<P>which says that the PostScript font should be reencoded using the encoding described in
enc_file; this file should consist of a sequence of lines of the form:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
pschar code
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>where pschar is the PostScript name of the character, and
code is its position in the encoding expressed as a decimal
integer. The code for each character given in the font file must correspond to the code for the character in encoding file, or to
the code in the default encoding for the font if the PostScript font is not to be reencoded. This code can be used with the
\N escape sequence in troff to select the character, even if the character does not have a
groff name. Every character in the font file must exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given in the font file must match the widths used in the PostScript
font. grops will assume that a character with a
groff name of space is blank (makes no marks on the page); it can make use of
such a character to generate more efficient and compact PostScript output.
</P>
<P>grops can automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary to print the document. Any downloadable fonts
which should, when required, be included by grops must be listed in the file
/usr/lib/groff/font/devps/download; this should consist of lines of the form:
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
font filename
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>where font is the PostScript name of the font, and
filename is the name of the file containing the font; lines beginning with
# and blank lines are ignored; fields may be separated by tabs or spaces;
filename will be searched for using the same mechanism that is used for
groff font metric files. The download file itself will also be searched for using this mechanism.
</P>
<P>If the file containing a downloadable font or imported document conforms to the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions, then grops will interpret any comments in the files sufficiently to ensure that its own output is conforming. It will
also supply any needed font resources that are listed in the download file as well as any needed file resources. It is also able
to handle interresource dependencies. For example, suppose that you have a downloadable font called Garamond, and also
a downloadable font called Garamond-Outline that depends on Garamond (typically, it would be defined to copy
Garamond's font dictionary, and change the PaintType), then it is necessary for Garamond to appear before Garamond-Outline in
the PostScript document. grops will handle this automatically provided that the downloadable font file for
Garamond-Outline indicates its dependence on Garamond by means of the Document Structuring Conventions, for example by beginning
with the following lines:
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
%%EndComments
%%IncludeResource: font Garamond
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>In this case, both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed in the download file. A downloadable
font should not include its own name in a
%%DocumentSuppliedResources comment.
</P>
<P>grops will not interpret %%DocumentFonts comments.
</P>
<P>The %%DocumentNeededResources,
%%DocumentSuppliedResources, %%IncludeResource,
%%BeginResource, and %%EndResource comments (or possibly the old
%%DocumentNeededFonts, %%DocumentSuppliedFonts,
%%IncludeFont, %%BeginFont, and %%EndFont comments) should be used.
