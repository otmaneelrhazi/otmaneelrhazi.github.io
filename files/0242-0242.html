<TR><TD>
.chopxx
</TD><TD>
Chop the last character off macro, string, or diversion
xx. This is useful for removing the newline from the end of diversions that are to be interpolated as strings.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.closestream
</TD><TD>
Close the stream named stream;
stream will no longer be an acceptable argument to the
write request. See the open request.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.continue
</TD><TD>
Finish the current iteration of a
while loop. See also the while and break requests.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.cpn
</TD><TD>
If n is nonzero or missing, enable compatibility mode; otherwise, disable it. In compatibility
mode, long names are not recognized, and the incompatibilities caused by long names do not arise.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.doxxx
</TD><TD>
Interpret .xxx with compatibility mode disabled. For example,
.do fam T would have the same effect as .fam T except that it would work even if compatibility mode had been enabled. Note
that the previous compatibility mode is restored before any files sourced by
xxx are interpreted.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.famxx
</TD><TD>
Set the current font family to xx. The current font family is part of the current environment.
See the description of the sty request for more information on font families.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.fspecialfs1s2 ...
</TD><TD>
When the current font is
f, fonts s1, s2, ... will be special; that is, they will searched
for characters not in the current font. Any fonts specified in the
special request will be searched after fonts specified in the
fspecial request.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.ftrfg
</TD><TD>
Translate font f to g. Whenever a font named
f is referred to in \f escape sequence, or in the
ft, ul, bd, cs, tkf, special, fspecial, fp, or sty requests, font
g will be used. If g is missing, or equal to f, then font
f will not be translated.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.hcodec1code1c2code2...
</TD><TD>
Set the hyphenation code of character
c1 to code1 and that of c2 to code2. A hyphenation code
must be a single input character (not a special character) other than a digit or a space. Initially,
each lowercase letter has a hyphenation code, which is itself, and each uppercase letter has a
hyphenation code which is the lowercase version of itself. See also the
hpf request.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.hlalang
</TD><TD>
Set the current hyphenation language to
lang. Hyphenation exceptions specified with the hw request and hyphenation patterns specified with the
hpf request are both associated with the current hyphenation language. The
hla request is usually invoked by the troffrc file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.hlmn
</TD><TD>
Set the maximum number of consecutive hyphenated lines to
n. If n is negative, there is no maximum. The default value is
_1. This value is associated with the current environment.
Only lines output from an environment count towards the maximum associated with that
environment. Hyphens resulting from \% are counted; explicit hyphens are not.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.hpffile
</TD><TD>
Read hyphenation patterns from
file; this will be searched for in the same way that
tmac.name is searched for when the _mname option is specified. It should have the same format as the argument
to the \patterns primitive in TeX; the letters appearing in this file are interpreted as
hyphenation codes. A % character in the patterns file introduces a comment that continues to the end of the
line. The set of hyphenation patterns is associated with the current language set by the
hla request. The hpf request is usually invoked by the
troffrc file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.hymn
</TD><TD>
Set the hyphenation margin to n: when the current adjustment mode is not
b, the line will not be hyphenated if the line is no more than
n short. The default hyphenation margin is 0. The
default scaling indicator for this request is m. The hyphenation margin is associated with the
current environment. The current hyphenation margin is available in
the \n[.hym] register.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.hysn
</TD><TD>
Set the hyphenation space to n: when the current adjustment mode is
b, don't hyphenate the line if the line can be justified by adding no more than
n extra space to each word space. The default hyphenation space is
0. The default scaling indicator for this request is
m. The hyphenation space is associated with the current environment. The current hyphenation space is available in
the \n[.hys] register.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.kernn
</TD><TD>
If n is nonzero or missing, enable pairwise kerning; otherwise, disable it.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.msofile
</TD><TD>
The same as the so request except that
file is searched for in the same way that
tmac.name is searched for when the _mname option is specified.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.nroff
</TD><TD>
Make the n built-in condition true and the
t built-in condition false. This can be reversed
using the troff request.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.openstreamfilename
</TD><TD>
Open filename for writing and associate the stream named
stream with it. See also the close and write requests.
