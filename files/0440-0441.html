</TD><TD>
These flags let you specify how the colors are interleaved. The default is
-interpixel, meaning interleaved by pixel. A byte of red, a byte of green, and a byte of blue, or
whatever color order you specified. -interrow means interleaved by
row&#151;a row of red, a row of green, a row of blue, assuming standard RGB color order. An
-interplane flag&#151;all the red pixels, then all the green, then all the blue&#151;would be an obvious extension, but is
not implemented. You could get the same effect by splitting the file into three parts
(perhaps using dd), turning each part into a PGM file with
rawtopgm, and then combining them with rgb3toppm.

<P>rcp&#151;Remote file copy
</P>

<P><B>
SYNOPSIS
</B>
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
rcp [-px] [-k realm] file1 file2
rcp [-px] [-r] [-k Ar realm] file ... directory
</PRE>

<P><B>
DESCRIPTION
</B>
</P>
<P>rcp copies files between machines. Each file or directory argument is either a remote filename of the form
rname@rhost:path, or a local filename (containing no
: characters, or a / before any : characters).
</P>
<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
-r
</TD><TD>
If any of the source files are directories,
rcp copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case the
destination must be a directory.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-p
</TD><TD>
Causes rcp to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification times and modes of the source
files, ignoring the umask . By default, the mode and owner of
file2 are preserved if it already existed; otherwise,
the mode of the source file modified by the umask
2 on the destination host is used.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-k
</TD><TD>
Requests rcp to obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
realm instead of the remote host's realm as
determined by krb_realmofhost 3.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-x
</TD><TD>
Turns on DES encryption for all data passed by
rcp. This may impact response time and CPU utilization,
but provides increased security.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>If path is not a full pathname, it is interpreted relative to the
login directory of the specified user ruser on
rhost, or your current username if no other remote username is specified. A path on a remote host may be quoted (using
\, &quot;, or `) so that the meta characters are interpreted remotely.
</P>
<P>rcp does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution via
rsh(1), and requires the same authorization.
</P>
<P>rcp handles third-party copies, where neither source nor target files are on the current machine.

HISTORY
</B></P>
<P>The rcp command appeared in BSD 4.2 . The version of
rcp described here has been reimplemented with Kerberos in
BSD 4.3 Reno.
</P>

<P><B>
BUGS
</B>
</P>
<P>Doesn't detect all cases in which the target of a copy might be a file when only a directory should be legal.
</P>
<P>Is confused by any output generated by commands in a or file on the remote host.
</P>
<P>The destination username and hostname may have to be specified as
rhost.rname when the destination machine is
running the BSD 4.2 version of rcp.

<P>rcs&#151;Change RCS file attributes

<P><B>
SYNOPSIS
</B>
</P>
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
rcs options file ...
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P><B>
DESCRIPTION
</B>
</P>
<P>rcs creates new RCS files or changes attributes of existing ones. An RCS file contains multiple revisions of text, an access
list, a change log, descriptive text, and some control attributes. For
rcs to work, the caller's login name must be on the
access list&#151;unless the access list is empty, the caller is the owner of the file or the superuser, or the
_i option is present.
</P>
<P>Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all others denote working files. Names are paired as explained in
ci(1). Revision numbers use the syntax described in
ci(1).</P>

<P><B>
OPTIONS
</B>
</P>
<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_i
</TD><TD>
Create and initialize a new RCS file, but do not deposit any revision. If the RCS file has no path prefix,
try to place it first into the subdirectory ./RCS, and then into the current directory. If the RCS file
already exists, print an error message.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_alogins
</TD><TD>
Append the login names appearing in the comma-separated list
logins to the access list of the RCS file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Aoldfile
</TD><TD>
Append the access list of oldfile
to the access list of the RCS file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_e[logins]
</TD><TD>
Erase the login names appearing in the comma-separated list
logins from the access list of the RCS file. If
logins is omitted, erase the entire access list.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_b[rev]
</TD><TD>
Set the default branch to rev.If
rev is omitted, the default branch is reset to the (dynamically)
highest branch on the trunk.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_cstring
</TD><TD>
Set the comment leader to string. An initial
ci,or an rcs _i without _c, guesses the comment leader
from the suffix of the working filename.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>This option is obsolescent, since RCS normally uses the preceding
$Log$ line's prefix when inserting log lines
during checkout (see co(1)). However, older versions of RCS use the comment leader instead of the
$Log$ line's prefix, so if you plan to access a file with both old and new versions of RCS, make sure its comment leader matches its
$Log$ line prefix.
</P>
<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_ksubst
</TD><TD>
Set the default keyword substitution to
subst. The effect of keyword substitution is described in
co(1). Giving an explicit _k option to co, rcsdiff, and
rcsmerge overrides this default. Beware rcs _kv, because<BR>
_kv is incompatible with co _l. Use rcs _kkv to restore the normal default keyword substitution.
