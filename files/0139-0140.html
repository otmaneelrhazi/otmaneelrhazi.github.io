_fstype type
</TD><TD>
File is on a filesystem of type
type. The valid filesystem types vary among different versions
of UNIX; an incomplete list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of UNIX or
another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K,
S52K. You can use _printf with the %F directive to see the
types of your filesystems.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_gid n
</TD><TD>
File's numeric group ID is n.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_group gname
</TD><TD>
File belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_ilname pattern
</TD><TD>
Like _lname, but the match is case-insensitive.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_iname pattern
</TD><TD>
Like _name, but the match is case-insensitive. For example, the patterns
fo* and F?? match the filenames Foo, FOO, foo, fOo, and so on.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_inum n
</TD><TD>
File has inode number n.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_ipath pattern
</TD><TD>
Like _path, but the match is case-insensitive.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_iregex pattern
</TD><TD>
Like _regex, but the match is case-insensitive.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_links n
</TD><TD>
File has n links.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_lname pattern
</TD><TD>
File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern
pattern. The meta characters do not treat / or . specially.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_mmin n
</TD><TD>
File's data was last modified n minutes ago.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_mtime n
</TD><TD>
File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_name pattern
</TD><TD>
Base of filename (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern
pattern. The meta characters (*, ?, and []) do not match a
. at the start of the base name. To ignore a
directory and the files under it, use _prune; see an example in the description of
_path.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_newer file
</TD><TD>
File was modified more recently than file.
_newer is affected by _follow only if _follow comes
before _newer on the command line.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_nouser
</TD><TD>
No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_nogroup
</TD><TD>
No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_path pattern
</TD><TD>
Filename matches shell pattern
pattern. The meta characters do not treat / or . specially; so,
for example,
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
find . _path `./sr*sc'
will print an entry for a directory called
./src/misc (if one exists). To ignore a whole directory
tree, use _prune rather than checking every file in the tree. For example, to skip the directory
src/emacs and all files and directories under it, and print the names of the other files found, do something
like this:
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
find . _path `./src/emacs' -prune -o -print
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_perm mode
</TD><TD>
File's permission bits are exactly mode (octal or symbolic). Symbolic modes use mode
0 as a point of departure.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_perm _mode
</TD><TD>
All of the permission bits mode are set for the file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_perm +mode
</TD><TD>
Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_regex pattern
</TD><TD>
Filename matches regular expression pattern. This is a match on the whole path, not a search.
For example, to match a file named ./fubar3, you can use the regular expression
.*bar. or .*b.*3, but not b.*r3.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_size n[bckw]
</TD><TD>
File uses n units of space. The units are 512-byte blocks by default or if
b follows n, bytes if c follows n, kilobytes if k follows
n, or 2-byte words if w follows n. The size does not count
indirect blocks, but it does count blocks in sparse files that are not actually allocated.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_true
</TD><TD>
Always true.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_type c
</TD><TD>
File is of type c. Possible types:

File's numeric user ID is n.

File was last accessed n days after its status was last changed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_user uname
</TD><TD>
File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID allowed).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_xtype c
</TD><TD>
The same as _type unless the file is a symbolic link. For symbolic links: if
_follow has not been given, True if the file is a link to a file of type
c; if _follow has been given, True if c is l. In
other words, for symbolic links, _xtype checks the type of the file that
_type does not check.

ACTIONS

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_exec command;
</TD><TD>
Execute command; True if 0 status is returned. All following arguments to find are taken to
be arguments to the command until an argument consisting of
; is encountered. The string {} is replaced by the current filename being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to
the command, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions of
find. Both of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a
\) nor quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell. The command is executed in the starting directory.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fls file
</TD><TD>
True; like _ls but write to file like
_fprint.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fprint file
</TD><TD>
True; print the full filename into file
file. If file does not exist when find is run, it is created; if
it does exist, it is truncated. The filenames
/dev/stdout and /dev/stderr are handled specially;
they refer to the standard output and standard error output, respectively.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fprint0 file
</TD><TD>
True; like _print0 but write to file like
_fprint.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_fprintf file format
</TD><TD>
True; like _printf but write to file like
_fprint.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_ok command;
</TD><TD>
Like _exec but ask the user first (on the standard input); if the response does not start with
y or Y, do not run the command, and return False.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_print
</TD><TD>
True; print the full filename on the standard output, followed by a newline.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_print0
</TD><TD>
True; print the full filename on the standard output, followed by a null character. This
allows filenames that contain newlines to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the
find output.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_printf format
</TD><TD>
 True; print format on the standard output, interpreting
n escapes and % directives. Field widths and precisions can be specified as with the
printf C function. Unlike _print, _printf does not add
a newline at the end of the string. The escapes and directives are as follows:

A literal percent sign.

File's last access time in the format returned by the C
ctime function.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
%Ak
</TD><TD>
File's last access time in the format specified by
k, which is either @ or a directive for the C
strftime function. The possible values for k are listed below; some of them might not
be available on all systems, due to differences in
strftime between systems.
@ seconds since Jan. 1, 1970, 00:00 GMT.
