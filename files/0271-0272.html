<P>Innconfval prints the values of the parameters specified on the command line. Values are retrieved from the
inn.conf(5) file and are described there.
</P>

<P>Values are retrieved by using the
GetConfigValue routine, or GetFileConfigValue if the

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>insmod installs a loadable module in the kernel.
</P>

<P>insmod tries to load a module into the kernel, and resolves all symbols from the exported kernel symbols, with
version information, if available. The module will get its name by removing the
.o extension from the basename of the object file.
If the .o extension is omitted, insmod will attempt to locate the module in some common default directories. If the
ENVIRONMENT contains the variable MODPATH, where all directories are separated with :,
insmod will look in these directories for the module, in the specified order.
</P>

<P>It is possible to load unversioned modules in a versioned kernel, and all combinations of these.
</P>

<P>It is also possible to load ELF modules into an
a.out kernel, and all combinations of these.
</P>

<P>It is possible to stack modules, that is, let one module use a previously loaded module. All modules that are referenced
are updated with this reference. This ensures that a module can't be unloaded if there is another module that refers to it.
</P>

<P>It is possible to change integer values in the module when loading it. This makes it possible to tune the module.
<P>

<P>The OPTIONS are as follows:
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_f
</TD><TD>
The _f option tries to load the module even if the kernel or symbol versions differs from
the version expected by the module. A warning will be issued if the module is locked to
a specific kernel version that differs from the current version.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_k
</TD><TD>
This option should really only be used by
modprobe, to indicate that the module insertion was requested by
kerneld. All modules inserted using this option will be subject
to autoremoval by the kerneld utility if they have been unused for more that a minute.
(The usage count is zero and no modules depend on this module.) If the kernel is not
kerneld-aware, the module will be rejected by the kernel. Just load it without the
-k option, and all should be well.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_m
</TD><TD>
The _m option will make insmod output a load map, that will make it easier to debug
your modules after a kernel panic, thanks to Derek Atkins
(warlord@MIT.EDU).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_o
</TD><TD>
The _o option allows the module to be named to an explicit name instead of having a
name derived from the name of the object file. Note that this option can also be placed after
the module name, so that the syntax of insmod looks more similar to
ld.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-272"><P>Page 272</P></A>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
symbol=value[,value] ...
</TD><TD>
The values of all integer or character pointer symbols in the module can be changed at
load-time by naming a symbol and giving the new value(s). If the symbol is defined as an array
of integers or character pointers, the elements in the array can be initialized by giving
the values separated by commas. Specific array entries can be skipped by omitting the value,
as in symbol=value1,,value2. Each integer value can be given as a decimal, octal, or
hexadecimal value: 17, 021, or 0x11. If the first character in the given value is nonnumeric, the
value is interpreted as a string. The symbol is assumed to be a character pointer, which will
be initialized to point to the string. Extra space in the module will be allocated for the
string itself. Note the syntax: no spaces are allowed around the
= or , signs!
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_s
</TD><TD>
With this option, insmod will produce debugging information and error messages using
the syslog facility. (Also used by kerneld, if you have installed it.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_v
</TD><TD>
If you want verbose information from the loading, select this option.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_x
</TD><TD>
The no-export flag, which will inhibit the default
insmod behavior&#151;inserting all the module's external symbols into the kernel symbol table. Note that the kernel will
still update the references that the module makes to previously loaded modules.

HISTORY
</B></P>

<P>The module support was first conceived by Anonymous (as far as I know). Linux version by Bas Laarhoven
(bas@vimec.nl). 0.99.14 version by Jon Tombs
(jon@gtex02.us.es). Extended by Bjorn Ekwall
(bj0rn@blox.se). ELF help from Eric Youngdale
(eric@aib.com).
</P>

<P><B>
BUGS
</B></P>

<P>insmod relies on the &quot;fact&quot; that symbols, for which one wants to change the value, are defined as integers or
character pointers, and that sizeof(int) == sizeof(char
*).

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>This manual page documents the GNU version of
install. install copies FILES and sets their permission modes and,
if possible, their owner and group. Used similarly to
cp; typically used in MakeFILES to copy programs into their
destination directories. It can also be used to create the destination directories and any leading directories, and to set the final
directory's modes. It refuses to copy FILES onto themselves.
