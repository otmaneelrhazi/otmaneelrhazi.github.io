<P>Commands for Manipulating the History</P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
accept_line (Newline, Return)
</TD><TD>
Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is. If this line is non_empty, add
it to the history list according to the state of the
HIST-CONTROL variable. If the line is a modified history line, then restore the history line to its original state.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
previous_history (C_p)
</TD><TD>
Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in the list.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
next_history (C_n)
</TD><TD>
Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the list.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
beginning_of_history (M_&lt;)
</TD><TD>
Move to the first line in the history.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
end_of_history (M_&gt;)
</TD><TD>
Move to the end of the input history, that is, the line currently being entered.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
reverse_search_history (C_r)
</TD><TD>
Search backward starting at the current line and moving &quot;up&quot; through
the history as necessary. This is an incremental search.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
forward_search_history (C_s)
</TD><TD>
Search forward starting at the current line and moving &quot;down&quot; through
the history as necessary. This is an incremental search.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
non_incremental_reverse_
search_history (M_p)
</TD><TD>
Search backward through the history, starting at the current line using a non_
incremental search for a string supplied by the user.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
non_incremental_forward_
search_history (M_n)
</TD><TD>
Search forward through the history using a nonincremental search for a string
supplied by the user.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
history_search_forward
</TD><TD>
Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the
start of the current line and the current point. This is a nonincremental search.
By default, this command is unbound.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
history_search_backward
</TD><TD>
Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the
start of the current line and the current point. This is a nonincremental search.
By default, this command is unbound.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
yank_nth_arg (M_C_y)
</TD><TD>
Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the second word
on the previous line) at point (the current cursor position). With an argument
n, insert the nth word from the previous command (the words in the
previous command begin with word 0). A negative argument inserts the nth word
from the end of the previous command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
yank_last_arg (M_., M__)
</TD><TD>
Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last word on the
previous line). With an argument, behave exactly like
@codefyank-nth-argg.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
shell_expand_line (M_C_e)
</TD><TD>
Expand the line the way the shell does when it reads it. This performs alias
and history expansion as well as all of the shell word expansions. See
&quot;History Expansion,&quot; later in this manual page, for a description of history expansion.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
history_expand_line (M_^)
</TD><TD>
Perform history expansion on the current line. See &quot;History Expansion.&quot;
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
insert_last_argument (M_., M__)
</TD><TD>
A synonym for
yank_last_arg.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
operate-and-get-next (C_o)
</TD><TD>
Accept the current line for execution and fetch the next line relative to
the current line from the history for editing. Any argument is ignored.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Commands for Changing Text</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
delete_char (C_d)
</TD><TD>
Delete the character under the cursor. If point is at the beginning of the
line, there are no characters in the line, and the last character typed was
not C_d, then return EOF.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
backward_delete_char (Rubout)
</TD><TD>
Delete the character behind the cursor. When given a numeric argument,
save the deleted text on the kill_ring.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
quoted_insert (C_q, C_v)
</TD><TD>
Add the next character that you type to the line verbatim. This is how to
insert characters like C_q, for example.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
tab_insert (C-v Tab)
</TD><TD>
Insert a tab character.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
self_insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)
</TD><TD>
Insert the character typed.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
