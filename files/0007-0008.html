Display a table listing the contents of archive, or those of the files listed in files that are present in
the archive. Normally, only the membername is shown; if you also want to see the modes
(permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can request that by also specifying the
v modifier.<BR>
If you do not specify any files, all files in the archive are listed.
<BR>
If there is more than one file with the same name (say,
fie) in an archive (say, b.a), ar t b.a fie will list only the first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete listing&#151;in our example,
ar t b.a.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
x
</TD><TD>
Extract members (named files) from the archive. You can use the
v modifier with this operation to request that ar list each name as it extracts it.
<BR>
If you do not specify any files, all files in the archive are extracted.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>A number of modifiers (mod) may immediately follow the
p keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior,
as follows:
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
a
</TD><TD>
Add new files after an existing member of the archive. If you use the modifier
a, the name of an existing archive member must be present as the membername argument, before the archive
specification.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
b
</TD><TD>
Add new files before an existing member of the archive. If you use the
modifier b, the name of an existing archive member must be present as the membername argument, before the archive
specification (same as i).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
c
</TD><TD>
Create the archive. The specified archive is always created if it didn't exist when you request an
update. But a warning is issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it by using this modifier.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
i
</TD><TD>
Insert new files before an existing member of the archive. If you use the modifier
i, the name of an existing archive member must be present as the membername argument, before the archive
specification. (same as b).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
l
</TD><TD>
This modifier is accepted but not used.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
o
</TD><TD>
Preserve the original dates of members when extracting them. If you do not specify this modifier,
files extracted from the archive will be stamped with the time of extraction.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
s
</TD><TD>
Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one, even if no other change is
made to the archive. You may use this modifier flag either with any operation, or alone. Running
ar s on an archive is equivalent to running ranlib on it.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
u
</TD><TD>
Normally, ar r... inserts all files listed into the archive. If you would like to insert only those of
the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same names, use this modifier. The
u modifier is allowed only for the operation r (replace). In particular, the combination
qu is not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed advantage from the operation
q.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
v
</TD><TD>
This modifier requests the verbose version of an operation. Many operations display
additional information, such as filenames processed, when the modifier
v is appended.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
V
</TD><TD>
This modifier shows the version number of
ar.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
</P>
<P>GNU as is really a family of assemblers. If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find
a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. Each version has much in common with the
others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.
</P>

<P>For information on the syntax and pseudo-ops used by GNU as, see
as entry in info (or the manual Using as: The GNU
Assembler).
</P>

<P>as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler
gcc for use by the linker ld. Nevertheless, we've
tried to make as assemble correctly everything that the native assembler would. This doesn't mean
as always uses the same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0
assembly language syntax.
</P>

<P>Each time you run as, it assembles exactly one source program. The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)
</P>

<P>If as is given no filenames, it attempts to read one input file from the
as standard input, which is normally your
terminal. You may have to type Ctrl-D to tell as there is no more program to assemble. Use
__ if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in your command line.
</P>

<P>as may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file (usually your terminal). This should not happen when
as is run automatically by a compiler. Warnings report an assumption made so that
as could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem that stops the assembly.
</P>
