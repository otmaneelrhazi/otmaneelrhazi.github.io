<P><B>
DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>installit puts a copy of source into the specified
destination.
</P>

<P>If source is a period, then destination is taken to be the name of a directory that should be created. Otherwise,
source is taken to name an existing file and
destination may be either a file or directory; it is interpreted according to the same rules<BR>
as cp(1).
</P>

<P>If destination names a preexisting file, it will be removed before the copy is done. To make a backup copy, use the _b
flag; the existing file will be renamed to have the specified extension. If
source and destination are the same string, or if the
two FILES are identical, then no copying is done, and only the
_o, _g, _m, and _s flags are processed. In this case, the
modification time on the destination will be updated using
touch(1) unless the _n (don't touch) flag is used.
</P>

<P>After the destination has been created, it is possible to set the owner, group, and mode that it should have. This is done
by using the _o, _g, and _m flags, respectively. The
_O and _G flags set the owner and group only if
installit is being run by root, as determined by
whoami(1). To strip(1) an installed executable, use the
_s flag.
</P>

<P>Note that installit uses no special privileges to copy FILES from one place to another.
</P>

BUGS and Limitations

<P>Flags cannot be combined.
</P>

<P>The chown(8) command must exist in either the /etc

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>ispell is fashioned after the spell program from ITS (called
ispell on Twenex systems.) The most common usage is
ispell filename. In this case, ispell will display each word which does not appear in the dictionary at the top of the screen
and allow you to change it. If there are &quot;near misses&quot; in the dictionary (words that differ by only a single letter, a missing or
extra letter, a pair of transposed letters, or a missing space or hyphen), then they are also displayed on following lines. As well
as near misses, ispell may display other guesses at ways to make the word from a known root, with each guess preceded
by question marks. Finally, the line containing the word and the previous line are printed at the bottom of the screen. If
your terminal can display in reverse video, the word itself is highlighted. You have the option of replacing the word completely
or choosing one of the suggested words. Commands are single characters as follows (case is ignored):

<P>If the _M switch is specified, a one-line mini-menu at the bottom of the screen will summarize these OPTIONS. Conversely,
the _N switch may be used to suppress the mini-menu. (The mini-menu is displayed by default if
ispell was compiled with the MINIMENU option, but these two switches will always override the default.)
</P>

<P>If the _L flag is given, the specified number is used as the number of lines of context to be shown at the bottom of the
screen. (The default is to calculate the amount of context as a certain percentage of the screen size.) The amount of context is
subject to a system-imposed limit.
</P>

<P>If the _V flag is given, characters that are not in the 7-bit ANSI printable character set will always be displayed in the style
of cat -v, even if ispell thinks that these characters are legal ISO Latin-1 on your system. This is useful when working
with older terminals. Without this switch, ispell will display 8-bit characters as is if they have been defined as string characters
for the chosen file type.
</P>

<P>Besides the _l, _a, and _A OPTIONS, Normal mode accepts the following common flags on the command line:

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The _n and _t OPTIONS select whether ispell runs in
nroff/troff (_n) or TeX/LaTeX (_t) input mode. (The default
is controlled by the DEFTEXFLAG installation option.) TeX/LaTeX mode is also automatically selected if an input file has
the extension .tex, unless overridden by the _n switch. In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a backslash
(\) is found, ispell skips to the next whitespace or TeX/LaTeX delimiter. Certain commands contain arguments that should not be checked, such
as labels and reference keys found in the \cite command, because they contain arbitrary, nonword arguments. Spell checking
is also suppressed when in math mode. Thus, for example, given
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
\chapter {This is a Ckapter} \cite{SCH86}
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>ispell will find &quot;Ckapter&quot; but not
&quot;SCH.&quot; The _t option does not recognize the TeX comment character
%, so comments are also spell checked. It also assumes correct LaTeX syntax. Arguments to infrequently used commands and some
optional arguments are sometimes checked unnecessarily. The bibliography will not be checked if
ispell was compiled with IGNOREBIB defined. Otherwise, the bibliography will be checked but the reference key will not.
</P>

<P>References for the tib(1) bibliography system (text between a
[. or &lt;. and .] or .&gt;) will always be ignored in TeX/LaTeX mode.
</P>

<P>The _b and _x OPTIONS control whether ispell leaves a backup
(.bak) file for each input file.
</P>

<P>The .bak file contains the precorrected text. If there are file opening/writing errors, the
.bak file may be left for recovery purposes even with the
_x option. The default for this option is controlled by the
DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.
