<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_U name
</TD><TD>
Do not predefine name. If both _U and
_D are specified for one name, the _U beats the _D and
the name is not predefined.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_undef
</TD><TD>
Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_A name(value)
</TD><TD>
Assert (in the same way as the
#assert directive) the predicate name with
tokenlist value . Remember to escape or quote the parentheses on shell command lines. You can use
_A- to disable all predefined assertions; it also undefines all predefined macros.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_dM
</TD><TD>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a list of
#define directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros. This
gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor; assuming you
have no file foo.h, the command
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
touch foo.h; cpp _dM foo.h
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
will show the values of any predefined macros.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_dD
</TD><TD>
Like _dM except in two respects: it does not include the predefined macros, and it outputs both
the #define directives and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the standard
output file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_M[_MG]
</TD><TD>
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make describing
the dependencies of the main source file. The preprocessor outputs one make rule containing
the object filename for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files. If there
are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using
\\ (newline).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
_MG says to treat missing header files as generated files and assume they live in the same directory
as the source file. It must be specified in addition to
_M.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_MM[_MG]
</TD><TD>
Like _M but mention only the files included with
#include &quot; file &quot;. System header files
included with #include &lt; file &gt; are omitted.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_MDfile
</TD><TD>
Like _M but the dependency information is written to
file. This is in addition to compiling the file as specified.
_MD does not inhibit ordinary compilation the way
_M does.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
When invoking gcc, do not specify the file argument.
gcc will create filenames made by replacing .c with
.d at the end of the input filenames.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
In Mach, you can use the utility md to merge multiple files into a single dependency file suitable
for using with the make command.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_MMDfile
</TD><TD>
Like _M except mention only user header files, not system header files.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_H
</TD><TD>
Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal activities.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_imacros file
</TD><TD>
Process file as input, discarding the resulting output, before processing the regular input
file. Because the output generated from file is discarded, the only effect of
_imacros file is to make the macros defined in file available for use in the main input. The preprocessor evaluates any
_D and _U options on the command line before processing _imacros file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_include file
</TD><TD>
Process file as input, and include all the resulting output, before processing the regular input file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-idirafter dir
</TD><TD>
Add the directory dir to the second
include path. The directories on the second
include path are searched when a header file is not found in any of the directories in the main
include path (the one that _I adds to).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-iprefix prefix
</TD><TD>
Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent
_iwithprefix options.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-iwithprefix dir
</TD><TD>
Add a directory to the second
include path. The directory's name is made by concatenating
prefix and dir, where prefix was specified previously with
_iprefix.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_lang-c
</TD><TD>
Specify the source language.
_lang-c++ makes the preprocessor handle C++ comment syntax,
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_lang-c++
</TD><TD>
and includes extra default include directories for C++, and
_lang-objc enables the Objective C
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_lang-objc
</TD><TD>
#import directive. _lang-c explicitly turns off both of these extensions, and
_lang-objc++ enables
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_lang-objc++
</TD><TD>
both. These options are generated by the compiler driver
gcc, but not passed from the gcc command line.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_lint
</TD><TD>
Look for commands to the program checker
lint embedded in comments, and emit them preceded by
#pragma lint. For example, the comment /* NOTREACHED
*/ becomes #pragma lint NOTREACHED.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>This option is available only when you call
cpp directly; gcc will not pass it from its command line.
