Command Area
</TD><TD>
This area contains several command buttons, described in the following list:
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The Set Save File button allows the user to modify file that the resources will
be saved to. This button will bring up a dialog box that will ask you for a
filename; after the filename has been entered, either hit carriage-return or click on
the Okay button. To pop down the dialog box without changing the save file,
click the Cancel button.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The Save button will append the resource line already described to the end of
the current save file. If no save file has been set, the Set Save File dialog box will
be popped up to prompt the user for a filename.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The Apply button attempts to perform a
XtSetValues call on all widgets that match the resource line described earlier. The value specified is applied
directly to all matching widgets. This behavior is an attempt to give a dynamic feel to
the resource editor. Since this feature allows users to put an application in states
it may not be willing to handle, a hook has been provided to allow
specific applications to block these SetValues requests. (See &quot;Blocking
editres Requests,&quot; following).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Unfortunately, due to design constraints imposed on the widgets by the
X Toolkit and the Resource Manager, trying to coerce an inherently static
system into dynamic behavior can cause strange results. There is no guarantee that
the results of an apply will be the same as what will happen when you save the
value and restart the application. This functionality is provided to try to give you
a rough feel for what your changes will accomplish, and the results
obtained should be considered suspect at best. Having said
that, this is one of the neatest features of
editres, and I strongly suggest that you play with it, and see what
it can do.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The Save and Apply button combines the Save and Apply actions
described earlier into one button.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The Popdown Resource Box button will remove the resource box from
the display.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P><B>
BLOCKING editres REQUESTS
</B></P>

<P>The editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget set. This allows all applications that are linked against
Xaw to be able to speak to the resource editor. Although this provides great flexibility, and is a useful tool, it can quite easily be
abused. It is therefore possible for any Xaw application to specify a value for the
editresBlock resource to keep editres from
divulging information about its internals, or to disable the
SetValues part of the protocol.
</P>

<P>editresBlock (Class Editresblock) specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to impose on the
editres protocol.
</P>

<P>The accepted values are as follows:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
all
</TD><TD>
Block all requests.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
setValues
</TD><TD>
Block all SetValues requests. As this is the only
editres request that actually modifies the application,
this is in effect stating that the application is read-only.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
none
</TD><TD>
Allow all editres requests.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Remember that these resources are set on any
Xaw application, not editres. They allow individual applications to keep all
or some of the requests editres makes from ever succeeding. Of course,
editres is also an Xaw application, so it may also
be viewed and modified by editres (rather recursive, I know); these commands can be blocked by setting the
editresBlock resource on editres itself.
</P>

<P><B>
RESOURCES
</B></P>

<P>For editres, the available application resources are as follows:
</P>

<P>numFlashes (Class NumFlashes) specifies the number of times the widgets in the application will be flashed when the
Show Active Widgets command in invoked.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-125"><P>Page 125</P></A>


<P>
flashTime (Class FlashTime) specifies the mount of time between the flashes described in the preceding entry.
flashColor (Class flashColor) specifies the color used to flash application widgets. A bright color should be used that
will immediately draw your attention to the area being flashed, such as red or yellow.
saveResourcesFile (Class SaveResourcesFile) is the file the resource line will be append to when the Save button activated
in the resource box.
</P>

<P><B>
WIDGETS
</B></P>

<P>In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets that compose
editres. In the following notation, indentation indicates hierarchical structure. The widget class name is given first, followed by the widget
instance name.
