DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>gzip reduces the size of the named FILES using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by
one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access, and modification times. (The default extension is<BR>
_gz for VMS, z for MS-DOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If no FILES are specified, or if a filename is
-, the standard input is compressed to the standard output.
gzip will only attempt to compress regular FILES. In particular, it
will ignore symbolic links.
</P>

<P>If the compressed filename is too long for its FILESystem,
gzip truncates it. gzip attempts to truncate only the parts of
the filename longer than three characters. (A part is delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small parts only, the longest
parts are truncated. For example, if filenames are limited to 14 characters,
gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.
Names are not truncated on systems that do not have a limit on filename length.
</P>

<P>By default, gzip keeps the original filename and timestamp in the compressed file. These are used when decompressing
the file with the _N option. This is useful when the compressed filename was truncated or when the time stamp was not
preserved after a file transfer.
</P>

<P>Compressed FILES can be restored to their original form using
gzip -d or gunzip or zcat. If the original name saved in
the compressed file is not suitable for its FILESystem, a new name is constructed from the original one to make it legal.
</P>

<P>gunzip takes a list of FILES on its command line and replaces each file whose name ends with
.gz, -gz, .z, -z, z, or .Z and which begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without the original extension.
gunzip also recognizes the special extensions .tgz and
.taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively. When compressing,
gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of truncating a file with a
.tar extension.
</P>

<P>gunzip can currently decompress FILES created by
gzip, zip, compress, compress -H, or pack. The detection of the input
format is automatic. When using the first two FORMATS,
gunzip checks a 32-bit CRC. For pack, gunzip checks the
uncompressed length. The standard compress format was not designed to allow consistency checks. However,
gunzip is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a
.Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply
because the standard uncompress does not complain. This generally means that the standard
uncompress does not check its input, and happily generates garbage output. The SCO
compress -H format (lzh compression method) does not include a CRC but
also allows some consistency checks.
</P>

<P>FILES created by zip can be uncompressed by
gzip only if they have a single member compressed with the deflation
method. This feature is only intended to help conversion of
tar.zip FILES to the tar.gz format. To extract zip FILES with
several members, use unzip instead of gunzip.
</P>

<P>zcat is identical to gunzip _c. (On some systems,
zcat may be installed as gzcat to preserve the original link to
compress.) zcat uncompresses either a list of FILES on the command line or its standard input and writes the uncompressed data
on standard output. zcat will uncompress FILES that have the correct magic number whether they have a
.gz suffix or not.
</P>

<P>gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and
PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
the input and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 60 to
70 percent. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by LZW (as used in
compress), Huffman coding (as used in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding
(compact).
</P>

<P>Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is
a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32KB block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015 percent for large FILES.
Note that the actual number of used disk blocks almost never increases.
gzip preserves the mode, ownership, and timestamps
of FILES when compressing or decompressing.

OPTIONS
</B></P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_a _ascii
</TD><TD>
ASCII text mode: convert end-of-lines using local conventions. This option is
supported only on some non-UNIX systems. For MS-DOS,
CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is converted to
CR LF when decompressing.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_c _stdout _to-stdout
</TD><TD>
Write output on standard output; keep original FILES unchanged. If there are several
input FILES, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members. To
obtain better compression, concatenate all input FILES before compressing them.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-250"><P>Page 250</P></A>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_d _decompress _uncompress
</TD><TD>
Decompress.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_f _force
</TD><TD>
Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple links or the
corresponding file already exists, or if the compressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If
the input data is not in a format recognized by
gzip, and if the option _stdout is also given, copy the input data without change to the standard output; let
zcat behave as cat. If _f is not given, and when not running in the background,
gzip prompts to verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_h _help
</TD><TD>
Display a help screen and quit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_l _list
</TD><TD>
For each compressed file, list the following fields: compressed size (size of the
compressed file), uncompressed size (size of the uncompressed file), ratio (compression ratio&#151;0.0%
if unknown), uncompressed name (name of the uncompressed file). The uncompressed size
is given as -1 for FILES not in gzip format, such as compressed
.Z FILES. To get the uncompressed size for such a file, you can use:
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
zcat file.Z | wc -c
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
In combination with the _verbose option, the following fields are also displayed:
method (compression method), crc (the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data),
date &amp; time (timestamp for the uncompressed file). The compression methods currently supported
are deflate, compress, lzh (SCO compress -H) and
pack. The crc is given as ffffffff for a file not in
gzip format.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
With _name, the uncompressed name, date and time are those stored within the
compressed file if present.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
With _verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all FILES is also displayed,
unless some sizes are unknown. With _quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_L _license
</TD><TD>
Display the gzip license and quit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_n _no-name
</TD><TD>
When compressing, do not save the original filename and timestamp by default.
(The original name is always saved if the name had to be truncated.) When decompressing,
do not restore the original filename if present (remove only the
gzip suffix from the compressed filename) and do not restore the original timestamp if present (copy it from the
compressed file). This option is the default when decompressing.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_N _name
</TD><TD>
When compressing, always save the original filename and timestamp; this is the
default. When decompressing, restore the original filename and timestamp if present. This option
is useful on systems that have a limit on filename length or when the timestamp has been
lost after a file transfer.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_q _quiet
</TD><TD>
Suppress all WARNINGS.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_r _recursive
</TD><TD>
Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the filenames specified on the
command line are directories, gzip will descend into the directory and compress all the FILES it
finds there (or decompress them in the case of
gunzip).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_S .suf _suffix .suf
</TD><TD>
Use suffix .suf instead of
.gz. Any suffix can be given, but suffixes other than
.z and .gz should be avoided to avoid confusion when FILES are transferred to other systems. A
null suffix forces gunzip to try decompression on all given FILES regardless of suffix, as in
the following:
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
     gunzip -S &quot;&quot; * (*.* for MS-DOS)
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
Previous versions of gzip used the .z suffix. This was changed to avoid a conflict
with pack(1).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_t _test
</TD><TD>
Test. Check the compressed file integrity.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_v _verbose
</TD><TD>
Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed or
decompressed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_V _version
</TD><TD>
Version. Display the version number and compilation OPTIONS, then quit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_# _fast _best
</TD><TD>
Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
#, where _1 or --fast indicates the fastest compression method (less compression) and
_9 or --best indicates the slowest compression method (best compression). The default compression level is
_6 (that is, biased towards high compression at expense of speed).
