DESCRIPTION
</B>
</P>


<P>glookbib prints a prompt on the standard error (unless the standard input is not a terminal), reads from the standard input
a line containing a set of keywords, searches the bibliographic databases
filename ... for references containing those
keywords, prints any references found on the standard output, and repeats this process until the end of input. For each
database filename to be searched, if an index
filename.i created by gindxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index
can cover multiple databases.

<P>The gnroff script emulates the nroff command using

ascii and latin1 will be ignored. The _h option is equivalent to the
grotty _h option. The _i, _n, _m, _o, and _r options have the
effect described in gtroff(1). In addition, gnroff silently ignores options of
_e, _q, or _s.

DESCRIPTION
</B>
</P>


<P>This manual page describes the GNU version of
pic, which is part of the groff document formatting system.
pic compiles descriptions of pictures embedded within
troff or TeX input files into commands that are understood by TeX or
troff. Each picture starts with a line beginning with
.PS and ends with a line beginning with .PE. Anything outside of
.PS and .PE is passed through without change.
</P>
<P>It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the
PS and PE macros. When the macro package being
used does not supply such definitions (for example, old versions of
_ms), appropriate definitions can be obtained with
_mpic: These will center each picture.
</P>
<P><B>
OPTIONS
</B>
</P>


<P>Options that do not take arguments may be grouped behind a single
_. The special option __ can be used to mark the end
of the options. A filename of _ refers to the standard input.
</P>

_C

Recognize .PS and .PE even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_n
</TD><TD>
Don't use the groff extensions to the
troff drawing commands. You should use this if you are using
a postprocessor that doesn't support these extensions. The extensions are described in
groff_out(5). The _n option also causes pic not to use zero-length lines to draw dots in
troff mode.

TeX mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_c

Be more compatible with tpic. Implies _t. Lines beginning with
n are not passed through transparently. Lines beginning with
. are passed through with the initial . changed to
\. A line beginning with .ps is given special

treatment: It takes an optional integer argument specifying the line thickness (pen size) in milli-inches; a
missing argument restores the previous line thickness; the default line thickness is 8 milli-inches. The line thickness
thus specified takes effect only when a nonnegative line thickness has not been specified by use of the
thickness attribute or by setting the linethick variable.

<P>The following options supported by other versions of
pic are ignored:

Draw all lines using the \D escape sequence.
pic always does this.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_Tdev

Generate output for the troff device
dev. This is unnecessary because the troff output generated by
pic is device-independent.

<P><B>
USAGE
</B>
</P>

<P>This section describes only the differences between GNU
pic and the original version of pic. Many of these differences
also apply to newer versions of UNIX pic.

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 93">
mode
</A></H4>

<P>mode is enabled by the _t option. In mode, pic will define a
vbox called ngraph for each picture. You must yourself print
that vbox using, for example, the command:
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
\centerline{\box\graph}
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>Actually, since the vbox has a height of zero, this will produce slightly more vertical space above the picture than below it,
the line
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
\centerline{\raise 1em\box\graph}
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>would avoid this.
</P>
<P>You must use a driver that supports the tpic specials, version 2.
</P>
<P>Lines beginning with \are passed through transparently; a
% is added to the end of the line to avoid unwanted spaces.
You can safely use this feature to change fonts or to change the value of
\baselineskip. Anything else may well produce
undesirable results; use at your own risk. Lines beginning with a period are not given any special treatment.

Concatenate the arguments and print as a line on
stderr. Each arg must be an expression, a position, or text. This is useful for debugging.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

</TD><TD>
Concatenate the arguments and pass them through as a line to
troff or TeX. Each arg must be an expression, a position, or text. This has a similar effect to a
line beginning with . or \, but allows the values of variables to be passed through.

Pass command to a shell. X can be
any character not occurring in command.
