<P>Some complex imake macros require generated
make variables local to each invocation of the macro, often because their
value depends on parameters passed to the macro. Such variables can be created by using an
imake variable of the form XVARdefn, where n is a single digit. A unique
make variable will be substituted. Later occurrences of the variable
XVARusen will be replaced by the variable created by the corresponding
XVARdefn.
</P>

<P>On systems whose cpp reduces multiple tabs and spaces to a single space,
imake attempts to put back any necessary tabs
(make is very picky about the difference between tabs and spaces). For this reason, colons
(:) in command lines must be preceded by a backslash
(\).
</P>

USE WITH THE X WINDOW SYSTEM
</B></P>

<P>The X Window System uses imake extensively, for both full builds within the source tree and external software. As
mentioned earlier, two special variables, TOPDIR and
CURDIR, are set to make referencing FILES using relative pathnames easier.
For example, the following command is generated automatically to build the
Makefile in the directory lib/X/ (relative to the
top of the sources):
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
% ../.././config/imake _I../.././config \
_DTOPDIR=../../. _DCURDIR=./lib/X
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>When building X programs outside the source tree, a special symbol
UseInstalled is defined and TOPDIR and CURDIR are omitted. If the configuration FILES have been properly installed, the script
xmkmf(1) may be used.
</P>

<P><B>
INPUT FILES
</B></P>

<P>Here is a summary of the FILES read by imake as used by X. The indentation shows which FILES include which other FILES.
</P>

<!-- CODE //-->

<P>
Note that site.def is included twice, once before the
*.cf file and once after. Although most site customizations should
be specified after the *.cf file, some, such as the choice of compiler, need to be specified before, because other variable
settings may depend on them.
</P>

<P>The first time site.def is included, the variable
BeforeVendorCF is defined, and the second time, the variable
AfterVendorCF is defined. All code in site.def should be inside a
#ifdef for one of these symbols.

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>Inews reads a Usenet news article (perhaps with headers) from the named file or standard input if no file is given. It
adds some headers and performs some consistency checks. If the article does not meet these checks (for example, too
much quoting of old articles, or posting to nonexistent newsgroups), then the article is rejected. If it passes the checks,
inews sends the article to the local news server as specified in the
inn.conf(5) file for distribution.
</P>

<P>In the standard mode of operation, the input consists of the article headers, a blank line, and the message body. For
com-patibility with older software, the _h flag must be used. If there are no headers in the message, then this flag may be omitted.
</P>

<P>Several headers may be specified on the command line, shown in the SYNOPSIS above as header flags. Each of these flags
takes a single parameter; if the value is more than one word (for example, almost all Subject lines) then quotes must be used
to prevent the shell from splitting it into multiple words. The OPTIONS, and their equivalent headers, are as follows:

Path prefix
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>The Path header is built according to the following rules. If the
_x flag is used, then its value will be the start of the
header. Any other host will see the site in the header, and therefore not offer the article to that site. If the
pathhost configuration parameter is specified in the
inn.conf(5) file, then it will be added to the Path. Otherwise, if the
server configuration parameter is specified, then the full domain name of the local host will be added to the Path. The Path will always end<BR>
not-for-mail.
</P>

<P>The default Organization header will be provided if none is present in the article or if the
_o flag is not used. To prevent adding the default, use the
_O flag.
</P>

<P>As a debugging aide, if the _D flag is used, the consistency checks will be performed, and the article will be sent to
the standard output, rather then sent to the server.
</P>

<P>For compatibility with C News, inews accepts, but ignores, the
_A, _V, and _W flags. The C News _N flag is treated as the
_D flag.
</P>

<P>If a file named .signature exists in the user's home directory,
inews will try to append it to the end of the article. If the
file cannot be read, or if it is too long (for example, more than four lines or one standard I/O buffer), or if some other
problem occurs, then the article will not be posted. To suppress this action, use the
_S flag.
</P>

<P>If the _R flag is used then inews will reject any attempts to post control messages.
</P>

<P>If an unapproved posting is made to a moderated newsgroup,
inews will try to mail the article to the moderator for
posting. It uses the moderators(5) file to determine the mailing address. If no address is found, it will use the
inn.conf file to determine a &quot;last-chance&quot; host to try.
</P>

<P>If the NNTP server needs to authenticate the client,
inews will use the NNTPsendpass-word(3) routine to authenticate itself.
In order to do this, the program will need read access to the
passwd.nntp(5) file. This is typically done by having the file
group-readable and making inews run setgid to that group.
</P>

<P>Inews exits with a zero status if the article was successfully posted or mailed, or with a nonzero status if the article could
not be delivered.
