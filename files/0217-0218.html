A profile file gmon.sum is produced that represents the sum of the profile information in all the

<P>The granularity of the sampling is shown, but remains statistical at best. We assume that the time for each execution of
a function can be expressed by the total time for the function divided by the number of times the function is called. Thus,
the time propagated along the call graph arcs to the function's parents is directly proportional to the number of times that arc
is traversed.
</P>

<P>Parents that are not themselves profiled will have the time of their profiled children propagated to them, but they will
appear to be spontaneously invoked in the call graph listing, and will not have their time propagated further. Similarly,
signal catchers, even though profiled, will appear to be spontaneous (although for more obscure reasons). Any profiled children
of signal catchers should have their times propagated properly, unless the signal catcher was invoked during the execution of
the profiling routine, in which case all is lost.
</P>

<P>The profiled program must call exit(2) or return normally for the profiling information to be saved in the
gmon.out file.

DESCRIPTION
</B>
</P>



<P>This file documents the GNU version of refer, which is part of the
groff document formatting system. refer copies the contents of
filename... to the standard output, except that lines between
.[ and .] are interpreted as citations, and lines between
.R1 and .R2 are interpreted as commands about how citations are to be processed.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-218"><P>Page 218</P></A>


<P>Each citation specifies a reference. The citation can specify a reference that is contained in a bibliographic database by
giving a set of keywords that only that reference contains. Alternatively, it can specify a reference by supplying a database record
in the citation. A combination of these alternatives is also possible.
</P>
<P>For each citation, refer can produce a mark in the text. This mark consists of some label that can be separated from the
text and from other labels in various ways. For each reference, it also outputs
groff commands that can be used by a macro package to produce a formatted reference for each citation. The output of
refer must therefore be processed using a suitable macro package. The
_ms and _me macros are both suitable. The commands to format a citation's reference can be
output immediately after the citation, or the references may be accumulated, and the commands output at some later point. If
the references are accumulated, then multiple citations of the same reference will produce a single formatted reference.
</P>
<P>The interpretation of lines between .R1 and .R2 as commands is a new feature of GNU refer. Documents making use of
this feature can still be processed by UNIX refer just by adding the lines:
<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.de R1
.ig R2
..
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->
<P>to the beginning of the document. This will cause
troff to ignore everything between .R1 and .R2. The effect of
some commands can also be achieved by options. These options are supported mainly for compatibility with UNIX refer. It
is usually more convenient to use commands.
</P>
<P>refer generates .lf lines so that filenames and line numbers in messages produced by commands that read
refer output will be correct; it also interprets lines beginning with
.lf so that filenames and line numbers in the messages and
.lf lines that it produces will be accurate even if the input has been preprocessed by a command such as
gsoelim(1).
