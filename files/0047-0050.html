DESCRIPTION
</B></P>


<P>bdftopcf is a font compiler for the X server and font server. Fonts in Portable Compiled Format can be read by
any architecture, although the file is structured to allow one particular architecture to read them directly without
reformatting. This allows fast reading on the appropriate machine, but the files are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines.
</P>

<P><B>
OPTIONS
</B></P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_pn
</TD><TD>
Sets the font glyph padding. Each glyph in the font will have each scanline padded in to a
multiple of n bytes, where n is 1, 2, 4, or 8.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_un
</TD><TD>
Sets the font scanline unit. When the font bit order is different from the font byte order,
the scanline unit n describes what unit of data (in bytes) are to be swapped; the unit
i can be 1, 2, or 4 bytes.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_m
</TD><TD>
Sets the font bit order to MSB (most significant bit) first. Bits for each glyph will be placed in
this order; that is, the leftmost bit on the screen will be in the highest valued bit in each unit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_l
</TD><TD>
Sets the font bit order to LSB (least significant bit) first. The leftmost bit on the screen will be in
the lowest valued bit in each unit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_M
</TD><TD>
Sets the font byte order to MSB first. All multibyte data in the file (metrics, bitmaps, and
everything else) will be written most significant byte first.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_L
</TD><TD>
Sets the font byte order to LSB first. All multibyte data in the file (metrics, bitmaps, and
everything else) will be written least significant byte first.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_t
</TD><TD>
When this option is specified, bdftopcf will convert fonts into terminal fonts when possible.
A terminal font has each glyph image padded to the same size; the
X server can usually render these types of fonts more quickly.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_i
</TD><TD>
This option inhibits the normal computation of ink metrics. When a font has glyph images that
do not fill the bitmap image (that is, the &quot;on&quot; pixels don't extend to the edges of the metrics),
bdftopcf computes the actual ink metrics and places them in the
PCF file; the _t option inhibits this behavior.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_o output-file-name
</TD><TD>
By default bdftopcf writes the
PCF file to standard output; this option gives the name of a file to
be used instead.

A Biorad image file may contain more than one image. With this flag, you can specify which image
to extract (only one at a time). The first image in the file has number zero. If no image number is
supplied, only information about the image size and the number of images in the input is printed out. No output
is produced.

BUGS

<P>A Biorad image may be in word format. If
PbmPlus is not compiled with the BIGGRAYS flag,
word files cannot be converted. See the makefile.

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>The bitmap program is a rudimentary tool for creating or editing rectangular images made up of 1s and 0s. Bitmaps are
used in X for defining clipping regions, cursor shapes, icon shapes, and tile and stipple patterns.
</P>
<P>The bmtoa and atobm filters convert bitmap files
(FILE FORMAT) to and from ASCII strings. They are most commonly used
to quickly print out bitmaps and to generate versions for including in text.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

USAGE
</B></P>

<P>bitmap displays grid in which each square represents a single bit in the picture being edited. Actual size of the bitmap
image, as it would appear normally and inverted, can be obtained by pressing Meta-I. You are free to move the image pop-up out
of the way to continue editing. Pressing the left mouse button in the pop-up window or Meta-I again will remove the real
size bitmap image.
</P>
<P>If the bitmap is to be used for defining a cursor, one of the squares in the images may be designated as the hot spot.
This determines where the cursor is actually pointing. For cursors with sharp tips (such as arrows or fingers), this is usually at
the end of the tip; for symmetric cursors (such as crosses or bulls-eyes), this is usually at the center.
</P>

<P>Bitmaps are stored as small C code fragments suitable for including in applications. They provide an array of bits as well
as symbolic constants giving the width, height, and hot spot (if specified) that may be used in creating cursors, icons, and tiles.
</P>

<P><B>
EDITING
</B></P>

<P>To edit a bitmap image, simply click on one of the buttons with drawing commands (Point, Curve, Line, Rectangle, and
so on) and move the pointer into the bitmap grid window. Press one of the buttons on your mouse and the appropriate
action will take place. You can either set, clear, or invert the grid squares. Setting a grid square corresponds to setting a bit in
the bitmap image to 1. Clearing a grid square corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 0. Inverting a grid
square corresponds to changing a bit in the bitmap image from
0 to 1 or 1 to 0, depending what its previous state was. The
default behavior of mouse buttons is as follows:
