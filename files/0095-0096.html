_P
</TD><TD>
Prune (remove) directories that are empty after being updated, on checkout, or update. Normally,
an empty directory (one that is void of revision-controlled files) is left alone. Specifying
_P will cause these directories to be silently removed from your checked-out sources. This does not remove the
directory from the repository, only from your checked out copy. Note that this option is implied by the
-r or _D options of checkout and export.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_p
</TD><TD>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output, rather than writing them in the
current directory. Available with the checkout and
update commands.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-r tag
</TD><TD>
Use the revision specified by the
tag argument instead of the default head revision. As well as
arbitrary tags defined with the tag or rtag command, two special tags are always available:
HEAD refers to the most recent version available in the repository, and
BASE refers to the revision you last checked out
into the current working directory. The tag specification is &quot;sticky&quot; when you use this option with
cvs checkout or cvs update to make your own copy of a file:
cvs remembers the tag and continues to use it on future
update commands, until you specify otherwise. tag can be either a symbolic or numeric
tag, in RCS fashion. Specifying the _q global option along with the
-r command option is often useful, to suppress the warning messages when the RCS file does not contain the specified tag.
-r is available with the checkout, commit, diff,
history, export, rdiff, rtag, and update commands.

Working Directory, or Repository?

a repository. Also, some commands change the repository, some change the

<P>Use the add command to create a new file or directory in the RCS source repository. The files or directories specified
with add must already exist in the current directory (which must have been created with the checkout command). To add a
whole new directory hierarchy to the source repository (for example, files received from a third-party vendor), use the
cvs import command instead.
</P>

<P>If the argument to cvs add refers to an immediate subdirectory, the directory is created at the correct place in the RCS
source repository, and the necessary cvs administration files are created in your working directory. If the directory already exists
in the source repository, cvs add still creates the administration files in your version of the directory. This allows you to use
cvs add to add a particular directory to your private sources even if someone else created that directory after your checkout of
the sources. You can do the following:
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
example% mkdir new_directory
example% cvs add new_directory
example% cvs update new_directory
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>An alternate approach using cvs update might be:</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
example% cvs update -d new_directory
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>(To add any available new directories to your working directory, it's probably simpler to use
cvs checkout or cvs update -d.)
</P>

<P>The added files are not placed in the RCS source repository until you use
cvs commit to make the change permanent. Doing a cvs
add on a file that was removed with the cvs remove command will resurrect the file, if no
cvs commit command intervened.
</P>

<P>You will have the opportunity to specify a logging message, as usual, when you use
cvs commit to make the new file permanent. If you'd like to have another logging message associated with just creation of the file (for example, to describe
the file's purpose), you can specify it with the _m
message option to the add command.
</P>

<P>The -k kflag option specifies the default way that this file will be checked out. The
kflag argument is stored in the RCS file and can be changed with
cvs admin. Specifying -ko is useful for checking in binaries that shouldn't have the RCS
id strings expanded.

<P>
This is the cvs interface to assorted administrative RCS facilities, documented in
rcs(1). cvs admin simply passes all its options and arguments to the
rcs command; it does no filtering or other processing. This command does work
recursively, however, so extreme care should be used.

<P>Make a working directory containing copies of the source files specified by modules. You must execute
cvs checkout before using most of the other cvs commands, since most of them operate on your working directory.

<P>modules are either symbolic names [themselves defined as the module
modules in the source repository; see cvs(5)] for
some collection of source directories and files, or paths to directories or files in the repository.

<P>Depending on the modules you specify, checkout may recursively create directories and populate them with the
appropriate source files. You can then edit these source files at any time (regardless of whether other software developers are editing
