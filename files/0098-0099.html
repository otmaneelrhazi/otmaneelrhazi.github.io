<P>cvs will only allow you to commit to a revision that is on the main trunk (a revision with a single dot). However, you
can also commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots) with the
-r option. To create a branch revision, one typically use the
_b option of the rtag or tag commands. Then, either
checkout or update can be used to base your sources
on the newly created branch. From that point on, all
commit changes made within these working sources will be
automatically added to a branch revision, thereby not perturbing mainline development in any way. For example, if you had to create
a patch to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version is already under development, you might use this:

<P>Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software, based on whatever revision you happened to
checkout last week. If others in your group would like to work on this software with you, but without disturbing mainline
development, you could commit your change to a new branch. Others can then check out your experimental stuff and utilize the
full benefit of cvs conflict resolution. The scenario might look like this:

<P>Others would simply do cvs checkout -rEXPR1

<P>You can compare your working files with revisions in the source repository, with the
cvs diff command. If you don't specify a particular revision, your files are compared with the revisions they were based on. You can also use the standard
cvs command option -r to specify a particular revision to compare your files with. Finally, if you use
-r twice, you can see differences between two revisions in the repository. You can also specify
_D options to diff against a revision in the past.
The -r and _D options can be mixed together with at most two options ever specified.
</P>

<P>See rcsdiff(1) for a list of other accepted options.
</P>

<P>If you don't specify any files, diff will display differences for all those files in the current directory (and its
subdirectories, unless you use the standard option
_l) that differ from the corresponding revision in the source repository (that is, files
that you have changed), or that differ from the revision specified.

<P>This command is a variant of cvs checkout; use it when you want a copy of the source for
module without the cvs administrative directories. For example, you might
use cvs export to prepare source for shipment off-site. This command requires
that you specify a date or tag (with _D or -r), so that you can count on reproducing the source you ship to others.
</P>

<P>The only nonstandard options are _d dir (write the source into directory
dir) and _N (don't shorten module paths). These have the same meanings as the same options in
cvs checkout.

<P>
The _kv option is useful when export is used. This causes any RCS keywords to be expanded such that an import done
at some other site will not lose the keyword revision information. Other
kflag options may be used with cvs export and are described in
co(1).

<P>Several options (shown as [_report] in the preceding bulleted code line) control what kind of report is generated:
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_c
</TD><TD>
Report on each time commit was used (that is, each time the repository was modified).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_m module
</TD><TD>
Report on a particular module. (You can meaningfully use
_m more than once on the command line.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_o
</TD><TD>
Report on checked-out modules.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_T
</TD><TD>
Report on all tags.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_x type
</TD><TD>
Extract a particular set of record types
X from the cvs history. The types are indicated by single
letters, which you may specify in combination. Certain commands have a single record type:
check-out (type O), release (type F), and rtag (type
T). One of four record types may result from an update:
W, when the working copy of a file is deleted during update (because it was gone from the repository);
U, when a working file was copied from the repository;
G, when a merge was necessary and it succeeded; and
C, when a merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring manual merging). Finally, one
of three record types results from commit: M, when a file was modified;
A, when a file is first added; and R, when a file is removed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_e
</TD><TD>
Everything (all record types); equivalent to specifying _xMACFROGWUT.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_z zone
</TD><TD>
Use time zone zone when outputting history records. The zone name
LT stands for local time; numeric offsets stand for hours and minutes ahead of UTC. For example,
+0530 stands for 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of (that is, east of) UTC.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The options shown as _flags constrain the report without requiring option arguments:
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_a
</TD><TD>
Show data for all users. (The default is to show data only for the user executing
cvs history.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_l
</TD><TD>
Show last modification only.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_w
</TD><TD>
Show only the records for modifications done from the same working directory where
cvs history is executing.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The options shown as _options args constrain the report based on an argument:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_b str
</TD><TD>
Show data back to a record containing the string
str in either the module name, the filename, or
the repository path.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_D date
</TD><TD>
Show data since date.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_p repository
</TD><TD>
Show data for a particular source repository (you can specify several
_p options on the same command line).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-r rev
</TD><TD>
Show records referring to revisions since the revision or tag named
rev appears in individual RCS files. Each RCS file is searched for the revision or tag.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_t tag
</TD><TD>
Show records since tag tag was last added to the history file. This differs from the
-r flag in that it reads only the history file, not the RCS files, and is much faster.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_u name
</TD><TD>
Show records for username.
