Use of undefined number registers. When an undefined number register is used, that register is
automatically defined to have a value of 0. A definition is automatically made with a value of
0. So, in most cases, at most one warning will be given for use of a particular name.

Missing space between a request or macro and its argument. This warning will be given when
an undefined name longer than two characters is encountered, and the first two characters of the name
make a defined name. The request or macro will not be invoked. When this warning is given, no macro
is automatically defined. This is enabled by default. This warning will never occur in compatibility mode.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
</B></P>

<P>Long names cause some INCOMPATIBILITIES. UNIX
troff will interpret
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.dsabcd
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>as defining a string ab with contents cd. Normally, GNU
troff will interpret this as a call of a macro named
dsabcd. Also UNIX troff will interpret \*[ or \n[ as references to a string or number register called
[. In GNU troff, however, this will normally be interpreted as the start of a long name. In
compatibility mode GNU troff will interpret these things in
the traditional way. In compatibility mode, however, long names are not recognized. Compatibility mode can be turned on
with the _C command-line option, and turned on or off with the
cp request. The number register \n(.C is 1 if compatibility
mode is on, 0 otherwise.
</P>

<P>GNU troff does not allow the use of the escape sequences in names of strings, macros, diversions, number registers, fonts,
or ENVIRONMENTs; UNIX troff does. The \A escape sequence may be helpful in avoiding use of these escape sequences in names.
</P>

<P>Fractional point sizes cause one noteworthy incompatibility. In UNIX
troff the ps request ignores scale indicators and so
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->

.ps 10u

<P>will set the pointsize to 10 points, whereas in GNU
troff it will set the pointsize to 10 scaled points.
</P>

<P>In GNU troff there is a fundamental difference between unformatted, input characters, and formatted, output
characters. Everything that affects how an output character will be output is stored with the character; after an output character has
been constructed, it is unaffected by any subsequent requests that are executed, including
bd, cs, tkf, tr, or fp requests. Normally output characters are constructed from input characters at the moment immediately before the character is added to
the current output line. Macros, diversions, and strings are all, in fact, the same type of object; they contain lists of
input characters and output characters in any combination. An output character does not behave like an input character for
the purposes of macro processing; it does not inherit any of the special properties that the input character from which it
was constructed might have had. For example, this:
</P>


<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
.di x
\\\\
.br
.di
.x
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>will print \\ in GNU troff; each pair of input
\s is turned into one output \ and the resulting output
\s are not interpreted as escape characters when they are reread. UNIX
troff would interpret them as escape characters when they were reread
and would end up printing one \. The correct way to obtain a printable
\ is to use the \e escape sequence: this will always print
a single instance of the current escape character, regardless of whether or not it is used in a diversion; it will also work in
both GNU troff and UNIX troff. If you wish for some reason to store in a diversion an escape sequence that will be
interpreted when the diversion is reread, you can either use the traditional
\! transparent output facility, or, if this is unsuitable, the
new \? escape sequence.
