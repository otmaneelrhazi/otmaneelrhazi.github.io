If greater than 0, the maximum number of objects on the input stack. If less than or equal to 0, there is

MISCELLANEOUS
</B></P>

<P>Fonts not listed in the DESC file are automatically mounted on the next available font position when they are referenced.<BR>
If a font is to be mounted explicitly with the fp request on an unused font position, it should be mounted on the first
unused font position, which can be found in the
\n[.fp] register; although troff does not enforce this strictly, it will not allow a
font to be mounted at a position whose number is much greater than that of any currently used position.

<P>If the font DESCRIPTION file contains pairwise kerning information, characters from that font will be kerned. Kerning
between two characters can be inhibited by placing a
\&amp; between them.
</P>

<P>In a string comparison in a condition, characters that appear at different input levels to the first delimiter character will
not be recognized as the second or third delimiters. This applies also to the
tl request. In a \w escape sequence, a character
that appears at a different input level to the starting delimiter character will not be recognized as the closing delimiter
character. When decoding a macro argument that is delimited by double quotes, a character that appears at a different input level
to the starting delimiter character will not be recognized as the closing delimiter character. The implementation of
\$@ ensures that the double quotes surrounding an argument will appear the same input level, which will be different to the input level<BR>
of the argument itself. In a long escape name ] will not be recognized as a closing delimiter except when it occurs at the
same input level as the opening ]. In compatibility mode, no attention is paid to the input level.
</P>

<P>There are some new types of condition:
</P>

<TR><TD>
.ifrxxx

True if there is a number register named

True if there is a string, macro, diversion, or request named
xxx.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
.ifcch

True if there is a character ch available;
ch is either an ASCII character or a special character
\(xx or \[xxx]; the condition will also be true if
ch has been defined by the char request.

WARNINGS
</B></P>

<P>The WARNINGS that can be given by troff are divided into the following categories. The name associated with each warning
is used by the _w and _W OPTIONS; the number is used by the
warn request, and by the .warn register.
