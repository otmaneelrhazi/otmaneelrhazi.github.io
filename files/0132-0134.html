BUGS
</P></B>

<P>There is a mailing list,
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu on the Internet
(ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs on UUCPnet), for reporting
emacs bugs and fixes. But before reporting something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is
a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate feature. We ask you to read the section &quot;Reporting
emacs Bugs&quot; near the end of the reference manual (or
info system) for hints on how and when to report bugs. Also, include the version number of
the emacs you are running in every bug report that you send in.
</P>

<P>Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report. The purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the
next release, if possible. For personal assistance, look in the
SERVICE file for a list of people who offer it.
</P>

<P>Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list. Send requests to be added to mailing lists to the special
list info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (or the corresponding UUCP address). For more information about
emacs mailing lists, see the file
/usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS. Bugs tend actually to be fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in
your interest to report them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.
</P>

<P>One bug that I know about: Shell will not work with programs running in Raw mode on some UNIX versions.

UNRESTRICTIONS
</B></P>

<P>emacs is free; anyone may redistribute copies of
emacs to anyone under the terms stated in the
emacs General Public License, a copy of which accompanies each copy of
emacs and which also appears in the reference manual.
</P>

<P>Copies of emacs may sometimes be received packaged with distributions of UNIX systems, but it is never included in
the scope of any license covering those systems. Such inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is permitted. In fact,
the primary purpose of the General Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other restrictions to redistribution <BR>
of emacs.
</P>

<P>Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend
emacs, and urges that you contribute your extensions to the
GNU library. Eventually GNU (GNU's Not UNIX) will be a complete replacement for Berkeley UNIX. Everyone will be free
to use, copy, study, and change the GNU system.

<P>In ~/.suntools or ~/.rootmenu, include a line like this:

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>emacstool creates a SunView frame and a tty subwindow within which mouse events and function keys are translated
to ASCII sequences that emacs can parse. The translated input events are sent to the process running in the
tty subwindow, which is typically GNU emacs.
emacstool thereby allows GNU emacs users to make full use of the mouse and function
keys. GNU emacs can be loaded with functions to interpret the mouse and function-key events to make a truly fine
screen-oriented editor for the Sun Workstation.

NOTE
</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
GNU emacs has a special interface to the X Window System as well. The X Window System has many technical
advantages, it is an industry standard, and it is also free software. The Free Software Foundation urges you to try X
Windows, and distributes a free copy of X on emacs distribution tapes.
</BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<P>Function keys are translated to a sequence of the form
^X*[a-o][lrt]. The last character is l, r, or t, corresponding
to whether the key is among the Left, Right, or Top function keys. The third character indicates which button of the group
was pressed. Thus, the function key in the lower-right corner will transmit the sequence
^X*or. In addition, the [lrt] is affected by the Control, Meta, and Shift keys. Unshifted Ctrl keys will be nonalphabetic: C-l
is [,], C-r is [2], C-t is [4].
</P>

<P>Mouse buttons are encoded as ^X^@([124] x y)\n.
^X^@ is the standard GNU emacs mouse event prefix; it is followed by a
list indicating the button pressed and the character row and column of the point in the window where the mouse cursor is,
and followed by a newline character. In GNU emacs, the
^X^@ dispatches to a mouse event handler which then reads the
following list.
</P>

<P><B>
OPTIONS
</B></P>

<P>emacstool supports all the standard window arguments, including font and icon specifiers.
</P>

<P>By default, emacstool runs the program emacs in the created subwindow. The value of the environment variable
EMACSTOOL can be used to override this if your version of
emacs is not accessible on your search path by the name
emacs. In addition, the run command can be set by the pathname following the last occurrence of the
_rc flag. This is convenient for using emacstool to run on remote machines.
</P>

<P>All other command-line arguments not used by the window system are passed as arguments to the program that runs in
the emacstool window.
</P>

<P>For example,
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
local% (emacstool -rc rlogin remote -8 &amp;)&amp;
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>will create an emacstool window logged in to a machine named
remote. If emacs is run from this window,
emacstool will encode mouse and function keys, and send them to
rlogin. If emacs is run from this shell on the remote machine, it will
see the mouse and function keys properly. However, since the remote host does not have access to the screen, the cursor
cannot be changed, menus will not appear, and the selection buffer
(STUFF) is limited.
