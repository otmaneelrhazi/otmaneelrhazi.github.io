USAGE
</B></P>

<P>Except when requesting general help with cvs _H, you must specify a
cvs_command to cvs to select a specific release
control function to perform. Each cvs command accepts its own collection of options and arguments. However, many options
are available across several commands. You can display a usage summary for each command by specifying the
_H option with the command.
</P>


<P><B>
CVS STARTUP FILE
</B></P>


<P>Normally, when cvs starts up, it reads the
.cvsrc file from the home directory of the user reading it. This startup
procedure can be turned off with the _f flag.
</P>

<P>The .cvsrc file lists cvs commands with a list of arguments, one command per line. For example, the following line
in .cvsrc:
</P>

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
diff _c
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>will mean that the cvs diff command will always be passed the
_c option in addition to any other options that are
specified in the command line (in this case, it will have the effect of producing context sensitive diffs for all executions of
cvs diff ).

CVS COMMAND SUMMARY
</B></P>

<P>Here are brief descriptions of all the cvs commands:</P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
add
</TD><TD>
Add a new file or directory to the repository, pending a
cvs commit on the same file. Can only be done from within sources created by a previous
cvs checkout invocation. Use cvs import to place whole
new hierarchies of sources under cvs control. (Does not directly affect repository; changes
working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
admin
</TD><TD>
Execute RCS control functions on the source repository. (Changes repository directly; uses
working directory without changing it.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
checkout
</TD><TD>
Make a working directory of source files for editing. (Creates or changes working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
commit
</TD><TD>
Apply to the source repository changes, additions, and deletions from your working
directory. (Changes repository.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
diff
</TD><TD>
Show differences between files in working directory and source repository, or between two revisions
in source repository. (Does not change either repository or working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
export
</TD><TD>
Prepare copies of a set of source files for shipment off site. Differs from
cvs checkout in that no cvs administrative directories are created (and therefore
cvs commit cannot be executed from a directory prepared with
cvs export), and a symbolic tag must be specified. (Does not change repository;
creates directory similar to working directories).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
history
</TD><TD>
Show reports on cvs commands that you or others have executed on a particular file or directory in
the source repository. (Does not change repository or working directory.) History logs are kept only
if enabled by creation of the
$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history file; see cvs(5).
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
import
</TD><TD>
Incorporate a set of updates from off-site into the source repository, as a &quot;vendor branch.&quot;
(Changes repository.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
log
</TD><TD>
Display RCS log information. (Does not change repository or working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
rdiff
</TD><TD>
Prepare a collection of diffs as a patch file between two releases in the repository. (Does not
change repository or working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
release
</TD><TD>
Cancel a cvs checkout, abandoning any changes. (Can delete working directory; no effect
on repository.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
remove
</TD><TD>
Remove files from the source repository, pending a
cvs commit on the same files. (Does not directly affect repository; changes working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
rtag
</TD><TD>
Explicitly specify a symbolic tag for particular revisions of files in the source repository. See also
cvs tag. (Changes repository directly; does not require or affect working directory.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
status
</TD><TD>
Show current status of files: latest version, version in working directory, whether working version
has been edited and, optionally, symbolic tags in the RCS file. (Does not change repository or
working directory.)
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-94"><P>Page 94</P></A>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
tag
</TD><TD>
Specify a symbolic tag for files in the repository. By default, tags the revisions that were last
synchronized with your working directory. (Changes repository directly; uses working directory
without changing it.)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
update
</TD><TD>
Bring your working directory up to date with changes from the repository. Merges are
performed automatically when possible; a warning is issued if manual resolution is required for
conflicting changes. (Changes working directory; does not change repository.)
</TD></TR></TABLE>

COMMON COMMAND OPTIONS
</B></P>

<P>This section describes the command_options that are available across several
cvs commands. Not all commands support all of these options; each option is only supported for commands where it makes sense. However, when a command has one
of these options you can count on the same meaning for the option as in other commands. (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have different meanings from one
cvs command to another.)

WARNING

<TR><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The history command is an exception; it supports many options that conflict
even with these standard options.
</BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
_D date
<C>
Use the most recent revision no later than
date_spec (a single argument, date description specifying
a date in the past). A wide variety of date formats are supported by the underlying RCS facilities,
similar to those described in co(1), but not exactly the same. The
date_spec is interpreted as being in the local time zone, unless a specific time zone is specified. The specification is &quot;sticky&quot; when you use it to
make a private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working file using
_D, cvs records the date you specified, so that further updates in the same directory will use the same date (unless you
explicitly override it; see the description of the
update command). _D is available with the checkout,
diff, history, export, rdiff, rtag, and update commands. Examples of valid date specifications include the following:

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
_f
</TD><TD>
When you specify a particular date or
tag to cvs commands, they normally ignore files that do
not contain the tag (or did not exist on the date) that you specified. Use the
_f option if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the tag or date. (The most recent version is used in
this situation.) _f is available with these commands:
checkout, export, rdiff, rtag, and update.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_H
</TD><TD>
Help; describe the options available for this command. This is the only option supported for all
cvs commands.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
_k kflag
</TD><TD>
Alter the default RCS processing of keywords; all the
_k options described in co(1) are available. The
_k option is available with the add, checkout,
diff, export, rdiff, and update commands. Your
kflag specification is &quot;sticky&quot; when you use it to create a private copy of a source file; that is, when you
use this option with the checkout or update commands,
cvs associates your selected kflag with the file,
and continues to use it with future update commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.
Some of the more useful kflags are _ko and
_kb (for binary files, only compatible with RCS version
5.7 or later), and _kv, which is useful for an export where you wish to retain keyword information after
an import at some other site.
