Flip Vertically
</TD><TD>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the vertical axes. If
a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked
area. Pressing V inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Left
</TD><TD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the left. If a marked area of
the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area. Pressing
LeftArrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Fold
</TD><TD>
This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite corners
become adjacent. This is useful when creating bitmap images for tiling. Pressing F inside
the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Right
</TD><TD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the right. If a marked area
of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area. Pressing the
right arrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Rotate Left
</TD><TD>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left (counter
clockwise.) If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the
marked area. Pressing L inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Down
</TD><TD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel down. If a marked area of the
grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area. Pressing the down
arrow inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Rotate Right
</TD><TD>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the right (clockwise.) If
a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked
area. Pressing R inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Point
</TD><TD>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if
a mouse button is being pressed down. If you drag the mouse button
continuously, the line may not be continuous, depending on the speed of your system
and frequency of mouse motion events.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Curve
</TD><TD>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if
a mouse button is being pressed down. If you drag the mouse button continuously,
it will make sure that the line is continuous. If your system is slow or bitmap
receives very few mouse motion events, it might behave quite strangely.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Line
</TD><TD>
This command will change the grid squares in a line between two squares. Once
you press a mouse button in the grid window, bitmap will highlight the line from
the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square where the
mouse pointer is located. By releasing the mouse button, you will cause the change to
take effect, and the highlighted line will disappear.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Rectangle
</TD><TD>
This command will change the grid squares in a rectangle between two
squares. Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, bitmap will highlight
the rectangle from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the
square where the mouse pointer is located. By releasing the mouse button you will cause
the change to take effect, and the highlighted rectangle will disappear.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Filled Rectangle
</TD><TD>
This command is identical to Rectangle, except at the end the rectangle will be
filled rather than outlined.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Circle
</TD><TD>
This command will change the grid squares in a circle between two squares.
Once you press a mouse button in the grid window, bitmap will highlight the circle
from the square where the mouse button was initially pressed to the square where
the mouse pointer is located. By releasing the mouse button you will cause the change
to take effect, and the highlighted circle will disappear.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Filled Circle
</TD><TD>
This command is identical to Circle, except at the end the circle will be filled
rather than outlined.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Flood Fill
</TD><TD>
This command will flood fill the connected area underneath the mouse
pointer when you click on the desired square. Diagonally adjacent squares are not
considered to be connected.

<TR><TD>
Set Hot Spot
</TD><TD>
This command designates one square in the grid as the hot spot if this bitmap
image is to be used for defining a cursor. Pressing a mouse button in the desired square
will cause a diamond shape to be displayed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Clear Hot Spot
</TD><TD>
This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap image.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Undo
</TD><TD>
This command will undo the last executed command. It has depth one, that
is, pressing Undo after Undo will undo itself.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P><B>
FILE MENU
</B></P>


<P>The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or
by pressing the Ctrl key with another key. These commands deal with files and global bitmap parameters, such as
size, basename, filename, and so forth.
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
New
</TD><TD>
This command will clear the editing area and prompt for the name of the new file
to be edited. It will not load in the new file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Load
</TD><TD>
This command is used to load a new bitmap file into the bitmap editor. If
the current image has not been saved, user will be asked whether to save or ignore
the changes. The editor can edit only one file at a time. If you need interactive
editing, run a number of editors and use the cut and paste mechanism as described later
in this section. (See &quot;Cut and Paste.&quot;)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Insert
</TD><TD>
This command is used to insert a bitmap file into the image being currently
edited. After being prompted for the filename, click inside the grid window and drag
the outlined rectangle to the location where you want to insert the new file.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Save
</TD><TD>
This command will save the bitmap image. It will not prompt for the
filename unless it is said to be &lt;none&gt;. If you leave the filename undesignated or _, the
output will be piped to stdout.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Save As
</TD><TD>
This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for a new filename.
It should be used if you want to change the filename.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Resize
</TD><TD>
This command is used to resize the editing area to the new number of pixels.
The size should be entered in the width&Aacute;height format. The information in the
image being edited will not be lost unless the new size is smaller that the current image
size. The editor was not designed to edit huge files.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Rescale
</TD><TD>
This command is used to rescale the editing area to the new width and height.
The size should be entered in the width&Aacute;height format. It will not do antialiasing
and information will be lost if you rescale to the smaller sizes. Feel free to add you
own algorithms for better rescaling.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Filename
</TD><TD>
This command is used to change the filename without changing the basename
nor saving the file. If you specify _ for a filename, the output will be piped to stdout.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Basename
</TD><TD>
This command is used to change the basename, if a different one from the
specified filename is desired.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Quit
</TD><TD>
This command will terminate the bitmap application. If the file was not saved,
user will be prompted and asked whether to save the image or not. Quit is preferred
over killing the process.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P><B>
EDIT MENU
</B></P>


<P>The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit button and selecting the appropriate menu entry, or
by pressing Meta key with another key. These commands deal with editing facilities such as grid, axes, zooming, cut and
paste, and so on.

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
Image
</TD><TD>
This command will display the image being edited and its inverse in its actual size
in a separate window. The window can be moved away to continue with
editing. Pressing the left mouse button in the image window will cause it to disappear
from the screen.
