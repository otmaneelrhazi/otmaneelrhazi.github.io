Dump Widget Tree to a File
</TD><TD>
When documenting applications it is often useful to be able to dump the entire
application widget tree to an ASCII file. This file can then be included in the manual page. When
this menu item is selected, a pop-up dialog is activated. Type the name of the file in this
dialog, and either select Okay, or type a carriage-return.
editres will dump the widget tree to this file. To cancel the file dialog, select the Cancel button.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Show Resource Box
</TD><TD>
This command will pop up a resource box for the current application. This resource
box (described in detail later in this section) will allow the user to see exactly which
resources can be set for the widget that is currently selected in the widget tree display. Only
one widget may be currently selected; if greater or fewer are selected,
editres will refuse to pop up the resource box and put an error message in the Message Area.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Set Resource
</TD><TD>
This command will pop up a simple dialog box for setting an arbitrary resource on
all selected widgets. You must type in the resource name, as well as the value. You can use
the Tab key to switch between the resource name field and the resource value field.

TREE COMMANDS
</B></P>


<P>The Tree menu contains several commands that enable operations to be performed on the widget tree.</P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
Select Widget in Client
</TD><TD>
This menu item allows you to select any widget in the application;
editres will then highlight the corresponding element the widget tree display. After this menu item
is selected, the pointer cursor will again turn to a crosshair, and you must click any
pointer button in the widget you wish to have displayed. Since some widgets are fully obscured
by their children, it is not possible to get to every widget this way, but this mechanism
does give very useful feedback between the elements in the widget tree and those in the
actual application.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Select All, Unselect All,Invert All
</TD><TD>
These functions allow the user to select, unselect, or invert all widgets in the widget tree.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Select Children,
Select Parents
</TD><TD>
These functions select the immediate parent or children of each of the currently selected
widgets.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Select Descendants,
Select Ancestors
</TD><TD>
These functions select all parents or children of each of the currently selected widgets. This
is a recursive search.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Show Widget Names,
Show Class Names,
Show Widget Windows
</TD><TD>
When the tree widget is initially displayed, the labels of each widget in the tree correspond
to the widget names. These functions will cause the label of all widgets in the tree to be
changed to show the class name, IDs, or window associated with each widget in
the application. The widget IDs, and windows are shown as hex numbers.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
In addition, there are keyboard accelerators for each of the Tree operations. If the
input focus is over an individual widget in the tree, then that operation will only affect
that widget. If the input focus is in the Tree background, it will have exactly the same effect
as the corresponding menu item.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The translation entries shown may be applied to any widget in the application. If
that widget is a child of the Tree widget, then it will only affect
that widget; otherwise, it will have the same effect as the commands in the Tree menu.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Flash Active Widgets
</TD><TD>
This command is the inverse of the Select Widget in Client command; it will show the
user each widget that is currently selected in the widget tree by flashing the corresponding
widget in the application numFlashes (three by default) times in the
flash-Color.

<P>Clicking button 1 on a widget adds it to the set of selected widgets. Clicking button 2 on a widget deselects all other
widgets and then selects just that widget. Clicking button 3 on a widget toggles its label between the widget's instance name
the widget's class name.

<P><B>
USING THE RESOURCE BOX
</B></P>

<P>The resource box contains five different areas. Each of the areas, as they appear on the screen from top to bottom,
are discussed in the following list:
</P>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
The Resource Line
</TD><TD>
This area at the top of the resource box shows the current resource name exactly as
it would appear if you were to save it to a file or apply it.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
The Widget Names and Classes
</TD><TD>
This area enables you to select exactly which widgets this resource will apply to.
The area contains four lines; the first contains the name of the selected widget and all
its ancestors, and the more restrictive dot (.) separator. The second line contains
less specific class names of each widget, as well as the less restrictive star
(*) separator. The third line contains a set of special buttons called Any Widget that will
generalize this level to match any widget. The last line contains a set of special buttons
called Any Widget Chain that will turn the single level into something that matches zero
or more levels.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
The initial state of this area is the most restrictive, using the resource names and
the dot separator. By selecting the other buttons in this area, you can ease the
restrictions to allow more and more widgets to match the specification. The extreme case is
to select all the Any Widget Chain buttons, which will match every widget in
the application. As you select different buttons, the tree display will update to show
you exactly which widgets will be affected by the current resource specification.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Normal and Constraint Resources
</TD><TD>
The next area allows you to select the name of the normal or constraint
resources you wish to set. Some widgets may not have constraint resources, so that area
will not appear.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Resource Value
</TD><TD>
This next area allows you to enter the resource value. This value should be
entered exactly as you would type a line into your resource file. Thus, it should contain
no unescaped newlines. There are a few special character sequences for this file:
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
\n-     This will be replaced with a newline.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
\###-     Where # is any octal digit. This will be replaced with a
single byte that contains this sequence interpreted as an
octal number. For example, a value containing a
NULL byte can be stored by specifying \000.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
\&lt;new-line&gt;-     This will compress to nothing.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>
\\-     This will compress to a single backslash.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
