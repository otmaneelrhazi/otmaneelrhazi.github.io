BUGS

<P>Doing fslsfonts _l can tie up your server for a very long time. This is really a bug with single-threaded
nonpreemptable servers, not with this program.

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>The fstobdf program reads a font from a font server and prints a BDF file on the standard output that may be used
to recreate the font. This is useful in testing servers, debugging font metrics, and reproducing lost BDF files.

DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>Reads a Usenix FaceSaver file as input. Produces a portable graymap as output.
</P>

<P>FaceSaver files sometimes have rectangular pixels. Although
fstopgm won't rescale them into square pixels for you, it will
give you the precise pnmscale command that will do the job. Because of this, reading a FaceSaver image is a two-step
process. First you do

<P>This will tell you whether you need to use
pnmscale. Then use one of the following pipelines:

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
fstopgm | pgmnorm
fstopgm | pnmscale -whatever | pgmnorm

fstopgm | pnmenlarge 3 | pnmscale &lt;whatever&gt; | pgmnorm | pgmtopbm
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P>You want to enlarge when going to a bitmap because otherwise you lose information; but enlarging by more than 3 does
not look good.

<P>ftp&#151;ARPAnet file transfer program

SYNOPSIS

<!-- CODE SNIP //-->
<PRE>
ftp [-v] [-d] [-i] [-n] [-g] [host]
</PRE>
<!-- END CODE SNIP //-->

<P><B>
DESCRIPTION
</B></P>

<P>ftp is the user interface to the ARPAnet standard File Transfer Protocol. The program allows a user to transfer files to
and from a remote network site.
</P>

<P>Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-148"><P>Page 148</P></A>


<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
-v
</TD><TD>
Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote server, as well
as report on data transfer statistics.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-n
</TD><TD>
Restrains ftp from attempting auto-login upon initial connection. If auto-login
is enabled, ftp will check the (see below) file in the user's home directory for an
entry describing an account on the remote machine. If no entry exists,
ftp will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on the local
machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which to login.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-i
</TD><TD>
Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-d
</TD><TD>
Enables debugging.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
-g
</TD><TD>
Disables filename globbing.
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>The client host with which ftp is to communicate may be specified on the command line. If this is done,
ftp will immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise,
ftp will enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user. When
ftp is awaiting commands from the user, the prompt

<P>is provided to the user. The following commands are recognized
by ftp :
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD>
! [command] [args]
</TD><TD>
Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine. If there are arguments, the first
is taken to be a command to execute directly, with the rest of the arguments as
its arguments.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
$ macro-name [args]
</TD><TD>
Execute the macro
macro-name that was defined with the macdef
command. Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
account [passwd]
</TD><TD>
Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system for access to
resources once a login has been successfully completed. If no argument is included, the
user will be prompted for an account password in a nonechoing input mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
append local-file [remote-file]
</TD><TD>
Append a local file to a file on the remote machine. If
remote-file is left unspecified, the local filename is used in naming the remote file after being altered by any
ntrans or nmap setting. File transfer uses the current settings for
type, format, mode, and structure.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
ascii
</TD><TD>
Set the file transfer type to network ASCII. This is the default type.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
bell
</TD><TD>
Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer command is completed.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
binary
</TD><TD>
Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
bye
</TD><TD>
Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
ftp. An end of file will also terminate the session and exit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
case
</TD><TD>
Toggle remote computer filename case mapping during
mget commands. When case is on (default is off), remote computer filenames with all letters in upper case
are written in the local directory with the letters mapped to lowercase.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cd remote-directory
</TD><TD>
Change the working directory on the remote machine to
remote-directory.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cdup
</TD><TD>
Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of the current
remote machine working directory.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
chmod mode file-name
</TD><TD>
Change the permission modes of the file
file-name on the remote system to mode.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
close
</TD><TD>
Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return to the
command interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
cr
</TD><TD>
Toggle carriage return stripping during ASCII type file retrieval. Records
are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed sequence during ASCII type file
transfer. When cr is on (the default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence
to conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter. Records on
non-UNIX remote systems may contain single linefeeds; when an ASCII type transfer is
made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when
cr is off.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
delete remote-file
</TD><TD>
Delete the file
remote-file on the remote machine.
